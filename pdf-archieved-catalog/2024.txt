William B. Davis, Interim Vice Provost.
The Division of Academic Engagement and Student
Achievement offers programs and courses that
support all undergraduates at WSU. One- to four-
credit courses are designed to fit student schedules
and can be paired with other University courses or
courses in the major for high-impact learning.
UNIV (university-wide) courses are one-, two-,
three-, and four-credit elective offerings designed
to help students from all majors develop the
knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary
to succeed in college, engage in high-impact
experiences, and graduate career-ready. UNIV
courses fall into four broad categories including
academic support and transition, career preparation
and exploration, leadership and global citizenship
development, and undergraduate research and
creative discovery. The curriculum is managed and
overseen by the UNIV Curriculum Committee.
In the UNIV curriculum, active and collaborative
learning environments develop teamwork and
leadership skills while also fostering positive
relationships with an inclusive community of
peers, faculty, and advising staff. Students’ progress
in their degree programs is supported by focus
on developing critical thinking, analytical, and
information skills, as well as by their strong written
and oral communications components. Frequent
reflective assignments assist students in integrating
their college experiences with their developing
sense of personal and social responsibility and self-
direction. UNIV courses also prepare students for
engagement in high impact practices that support
their educational and career goals, including
internships and undergraduate research, and
creative activities.
The Writing Program’s prefix, WRITE, offers a
selection of 1-credit courses designed to support
WSU students with the writing they are doing in
their classes and in other academic and professional
contexts. These courses offer low-risk, high-contact
environments in which to learn and practice writing
skills that will serve students as they write in their
disciplines and in their future careers.
All WRITE courses are designed to be taken
concurrently with a writing-intensive course such
as English 101/105, a UCORE course such as History
105, or an “M” course (writing in the major). WRITE
courses prioritize contextualized practice, so that
students learn more about writing based on the
writing they’re already doing for other courses,
as well as self-regulated learning models that
guide students to determine and pursue their own
learning goals.
Finally, the Division of Academic Engagement
and Student Achievement supports general
education at WSU through the University Common
Requirements (UCORE) Program. Information
about UCORE can be found in other parts of the
WSU Catalog or online through the UCORE website.

Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC)
AFROTC is a nationwide program that allows
full-time college students to pursue military
commissions and become officers in the United
States Air Force (USAF) and United States Space
Force (USSF) while simultaneously attending
university. AFROTC classes are held on college
campuses throughout the United States and Puerto
Rico, and students can register through normal
course registration processes.
The AFROTC program consists of four years of
Aerospace Studies classes, to include: Heritage
and Values, Team and Leadership Fundamentals,
Leading People and Effective Communication,
and National Security, Leadership Responsibilities,
and Commissioning Preparation. Each of the
four years is accompanied by a corresponding
Leadership Laboratory course. During Leadership
Laboratory, students apply leadership skills,

59
Agricultural and Food Systems
Washington State University, 2024
demonstrate command principles, practice effective
communication skills, develop physical fitness,
and learn military customs and courtesies. College
students pursuing a military commission are
enrolled in the AFROTC program as “cadets”. Upon
successful completion of AFROTC training and
college degree requirements, cadets will graduate
and commission as Second Lieutenants in the
Active-Duty component of the USAF or the USSF.
The AFROTC program is currently offered
at Washington State University, but there are
agreements that allow University of Idaho, Lewis-
Clark State College, and Whitworth University
students to enroll in AFROTC and become full-
fledged cadet participants. Students interested
in learning about military culture, but not in
pursuing a military commission, are eligible to
enroll in the Heritage and Values or Team and
Leadership Fundamentals courses as participating
students rather than cadets. For more information
on AFROTC course descriptions, please review the
Washington State University course catalog. For
more information on the AFROTC program, please

Program in Aging
Johnson Tower 501
509-335-8439
Chair, R. Weaver.
The Program in Aging offers an interdisciplinary
curriculum in gerontology, including courses in the
social and health sciences. Students may earn a
Minor or Certificate in Gerontology*. The program
is designed to achieve the following objectives:
• To provide a body of knowledge which
individuals may use in better understanding the
processes and implications of aging in their own
lives and for participation in community decision
making regarding the scope, structure, and nature
of programs for the elderly;
• To enhance the qualifications of students in the
helping services, health sciences, communication,
education, and business, who are planning careers
which involve working with or providing services
to older persons;
• To prepare students for graduate and professional
training in gerontology; and
• To further university and societal goals of equity
for persons of all ages
Coursework in gerontology prepares students
for a variety of careers or graduate education in a
significantly growing field that focuses on adults,
older adults, and intergenerational programs/
outreach. While example careers can include direct
care to older people and their families (e.g., activities
coordination, counseling, recreational therapy,
health programs and services), there are also many
opportunities for teaching, research, planning, and
advocacy work in business and industry, product
development, non-profits or government agencies
(e.g., marketing, long-term care administration,
data analyst for aging policy issues).

Feed the world. Power the planet. Save the
environment. It’s a tall order by any measure, but
especially when you consider that experts predict
that by 2050, the world population will grow to
more than 9 billion human beings. Join WSU’s
Agricultural and Food Systems (AFS) degree program
and focus on vital aspects of agricultural and food
systems ranging from plant and animal production
to marketing and education. This innovative
program provides students with what they need
to build or work in a modern food system that is
productive, competitive and sustainable.
Delivered collaboratively by departments within
the College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural
Resource Sciences, the AFS program provides
foundational education in a wide array of disciplines,
including crop and soil sciences, animal science, food
science, horticulture, entomology, plant pathology,
and economics. Students can choose among five
Bachelor of Science degree majors: Agricultural
Education; Agricultural Technology and Production
Management; Agricultural and Food Business
Economics; Human Nutrition and Food Systems;
and Organic and Sustainable Agriculture. The
college offers a minor in Agricultural Systems, which
is specifically designed to complement a major in
Communications, for students interested in careers
in the communications sector of the agricultural
industry. Additional minors in Agricultural Systems,
Precision Agriculture, and Agricultural Technology
and Production Management are also available.
The college also offers an interdisciplinary Master
of Science in Agriculture degree, an undergraduate
Certificate in Organic Agriculture, and a graduate
Certificate in Sustainable Agriculture.
A student may be admitted to an AFS major upon
making their intention known to the department.
For complete information about all majors within
the AFS degree programs, please see the AFS webpage
at: http://afs.wsu.edu.
Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and
Food Systems (Pullman campus)
Systems not silos. The AFS degree program
emphasizes the highly integrated nature of the
science disciplines involved in growing food.
All students take a core set of courses designed
to provide them with a broad interdisciplinary
background as well as the decision-making skills
they’ll need to succeed and excel in the workplace.
Capstone courses. At the end of their program,
most students take an AFS capstone course.
Agricultural Education students take a teaching
experience capstone. These capstone courses are
designed specifically to provide a culminating
experience to help in preparing students to
be “job-ready, day one”. In the standard AFS
capstone, guest lectures from industry professionals
challenge students on topics including developing
your personal brand, project management, sales
101, private agricultural business ownership and
succession planning, and the performance review
process. A fundamental part of the capstone
experience is a team-based, semester-long project
where small groups of students address an emerging
issue or problem and provide recommendations
to one an industry partner (co-ops, private
companies, etc.). Students meet regularly with
industry partners (face-to-face, videoconference,
phone) to define their project, collect research
information, and develop a project plan. They
prepare meeting agendas, take minutes and report
back to instructors to identify what worked, what
did not work, and what changes they plan to
make for the next meeting. Besides introducing
students to their business and colleagues, industry
partners provide in-house research background
information, assist in distributing employee surveys
and provide excellent professional mentoring for
students. At the end of the semester, student teams
provide both a comprehensive written report
and an oral presentation about their project and
industry recommendations both to their peers and
to industry leaders. In the teaching experience
capstone (Agricultural Education majors), students
teach their last semester as their internship in
education. Students are required to complete the
Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) as part
of the course. Additionally, Agricultural Education
student teachers supervise students in and outside of
a classroom and laboratory setting. Extensive lesson
planning, materials preparation, SAE (Supervised
Agricultural Experience) supervision, FFA activity
involvement, and professional engagement are
major components of the field experience of student
teaching.
In addition to WSU’s Six Learning Goals of the
Baccalaureate, graduates with a major in AFS will
be able to:

ORGANIC AND SUSTAINABLE
AGRICULTURE
(120 CREDITS)
Significantly different than conventional
agriculture, organic food production is one of the
fastest growing segments of agriculture, with retail
sales increasing by 20 percent annually since 1991.
In many ways, Washington State has been a leader
in this burgeoning new industry. This revolutionary
new major is the first of its kind to be offered in the
United States. Students in this major take a diverse
array of courses in the natural, environmental,
economic, and social sciences, as well as a number
of courses focused on organic production practices.
Students wanting a hands-on degree experience
thrive in the organic major. WSU has over a four-
acre certified organic teaching farm where students
learn to produce certified organic vegetables, fruit,
herbs, and flowers that they distribute through local
food banks, on-campus food service, a 100-member
CSA (community supported agriculture), and a local
farmers’ market. Students have the opportunity
to tailor their program of study to specific areas
of emphasis, such as organic animal and dairy
production, economics and marketing, crop
production, food science, pest management, soil
management, etc. in consultation with their advisor.
The Organic and Sustainable Agriculture Program
at WSU prepares students to work on or develop
their own organic farm. It also prepares students
for employment opportunities with nonprofit
organizations and government agencies involved
in environmental and food safety, as well as
private-sector food processing, marketing, organic
certification, and product development industries.
Students may be admitted to the Organic and
Sustainable Agriculture major upon making their
intentions known to the department.

professionals working in agriculture or related
fields who require in-depth knowledge of organic
systems, those wanting to pursue a career in organic
agriculture, anyone interested in beginning a
community-supported agriculture (CSA) enterprise,
home gardeners, as well as current WSU students
in other majors at WSU with an interest in organic
agriculture. Students develop knowledge and
skills that are applicable to industries and agencies
involved in the food chain-from production,
processing, and delivery to policy, regulation, and
education.
The 18-credit certificate program is designed
with 3 core courses (9 credit hours) required
for all students, 3 credit hours of “experiential
learning”, plus a minimum of 6 additional credit
hours (electives) selected from a range of courses. All
courses already exist as permanent courses, and the
certificate can be fulfilled through on-line delivery
or in-class participation on the Pullman campus.

The Department of Animal Sciences offers courses
of study leading to the degrees of Bachelor of
Science in Animal Sciences, Master of Science in
Animal Sciences, and Doctor of Philosophy (Animal
Sciences). The department participates in the
Joint Program for Animal Sciences and Veterinary
Medicine, leading to the degrees of Bachelor of
Science in Animal Sciences and Doctor of Veterinary
Medicine.
Bachelor of Science in Animal Sciences
The Department of Animal Sciences provides
training in the biological systems important
to animals, including principles and practices
associated with the management and well-being of
agricultural animal production. Care and well-being
of companion and laboratory animals is also taught.
Animal Scientists at WSU are experts in animal
nutrition, physiology, reproduction, genetics and
genomics, nutrient management, meat and muscle
biology, and animal behavior. They bring this
expertise to the classroom and to the experiential
learning activities offered to our students. Unique
hands-on learning opportunities with animals
allow our students to practice and apply what they
learn in the classroom. Most departmental faculty
are engaged in the many multidisciplinary Centers
across the WSU campus which provides additional
broadening and experiential opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students.
The undergraduate curriculum prepares graduates
for a wide variety of career paths. These paths
include animal production and food processing
(meats, dairy products, etc.); animal research;
biomedical research; wild and zoological animal
care; companion animal services; the agricultural
service industries (including feed manufacturing
and sales, pharmaceuticals, artificial insemination,
agricultural equipment, financial institutions, etc.);
and government agencies. Graduates of the Animal
Sciences program are well prepared to continue
their education by pursuing graduate or professional
degrees in the sciences and veterinary and human
medicine fields. Employers seek out graduates in
Animal Sciences for their strong foundation in
science, practical and technical knowledge of
animal care, and hands-on experience with animal
production.
Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the Bachelor’s Degree in
Animal Sciences, it is expected that graduates will
be able to:
• Develop and evaluate animal production and
management systems by integrating knowledge
of animal genetics, nutrition, reproduction, and
other relevant disciplines and applying scientific
and quantitative reasoning to solve real-world
challenges.
• Locate, critically evaluate, and apply information
from scholarly animal science literature and
other sources to expand personal understanding
and knowledge of animal sciences, providing a
foundation for lifelong learning.
• Create and interpret graphs, tables and diagrams
illustrating scientific data and concepts, and
understand basic concepts relating to the design
and analysis of research in the animal sciences.
• Communicate effectively, both orally and
in writing, about animal sciences to a range of
audiences using appropriate traditional and
emerging media.
• Engage actively and effectively in discussion
of complex issues relevant to animal sciences by
understanding and appreciating:
• the importance of animals to the health and well-
being of society;
• economic, environmental, animal welfare,
and societal impacts of animal production and
management systems at the local and global levels;
• varied ethical perspectives on animal practices;
• the role of science in informing debates.
• Appreciate the breadth and depth of professional
opportunities in animal sciences relating to: the
keeping of animals for food and fiber production
and other purposes (e.g., species conservation,
c o m p a n i o n s h i p , r e s e a rc h a n d t e a c h i n g ,
biotechnology, sports); the application of scientific
principles to animal breeding, reproduction,
feeding, growth and development, health
management, housing, handling, and end–product
safety and quality.
Degree Options in Animal Sciences
Students in Animal Sciences take a wide variety of
agricultural and non-agricultural courses, receiving
in-depth training in the comparative biology of
farm and companion animals. Students select a
degree option to coincide with their interests. Each
option has both required courses and electives,
which allow individual program specialization in
areas of animal science, technology, and production
or pre-veterinary medicine/science. The Animal
Science, Technology, and Production curriculum
is designed to provide students with the scientific,
technological, and practical knowledge, and
communication skills to make them productive
members of the food production, animal care and
related industries. The Pre-veterinary/Science option
is designed to provide graduates with the skills to be
successful in the biomedical or veterinary sciences,
biotechnology or other science related fields.
The Animal Science, Technology, and Production
Option emphasizes the business, economic and
science-based practical management aspects of
animal production and care of animals. This option
is recommended for students preparing to work in
agricultural animal production, companion animal
care, or agribusiness.
The Pre-veterinary/Science Option places
emphasis on basic science courses. This option
is recommended for students planning to attend
graduate school, apply to the professional program

Animal Sciences
Washington State University, 2024
leading to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
or other post-baccalaureate degree, or work in
technical or specialized areas of animal science,
such as extension, academia, research, technical
consulting, or laboratory research.
Many opportunities outside the classroom are
available for students to further their educational
experiences. Animal Sciences students are strongly
encouraged to participate as part-time employees
in the livestock centers, or in research and teaching
programs within the department. Opportunities
are available to students for on-the-job training in
professional internships within diverse segments
of the agricultural, companion animal, veterinary,
biomedical, or research sectors. The department
offers experiential learning opportunities with dairy
cattle, beef cattle, and swine that allow students
to practice decision making and management
skills. Active student clubs within the Department
of Animal Sciences, the College of Agricultural,
Human, and Natural Resource Sciences, and the
university community provide students with
both professional and social contacts with faculty
and other students. Departmental and college
scholarships are available based on ability, financial
need and interest.
Animal Sciences courses are attractive to students
in other majors and from any background. Animal
Sciences courses broaden a student’s knowledge
of applied and basic biology, agriculture and the
environment, and society in general. Many students
find that obtaining a minor in Animal Sciences
complements and adds depth to other majors.
Transfer Students
Students planning to transfer to the Department
of Animal Sciences, Washington State University,
from community colleges or other institutions
should complete as many science, mathematics,
and University Common Requirements (UCORE)
courses as possible prior to transferring. Inquiries
about specific courses should be directed to the
Undergraduate Academic Coordinator in the
department.
Schedules of Studies
Honors students complete the Honors
College requirements which replace the
UCORE requirements.

N. P. McKee.
The curriculum includes courses in the four major
subfields of anthropology: archaeology, cultural/
social anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and
biological anthropology. These courses familiarize
students with current issues in human evolution,
linguistics, the development of culture, and
cultural theory. Undergraduate majors are required
to gain a background in all four of these major
subfields. Graduate students may specialize in
archaeology, cultural anthropology, or evolutionary
anthropology. The program in archaeology
emphasizes research and training in the archaeology
of the Americas, including the Pacific Northwest,
the Intermountain West, the Southwest, the Plains,
Mesoamerica, and the Andes. Faculty specialize
in archaeological science and community based
Indigenous research methods. The department
also conducts summer archaeological field schools.
The program in cultural anthropology emphasizes
ethnography, ethnobiology, medical anthropology,
biocultural perspectives, and public health
anthropology. Faculty research is based in North
and Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South
Asia. The program in evolutionary anthropology
emphasizes biocultural perspectives, behavioral
ecology, evolutionary psychology, primatology, and
evolutionary cultural anthropology. Evolutionary
faculty have research interests that span several
continents including the Americas, Europe,
Southeast Asia, and Africa.
Departmental offices and laboratories are
located in College Hall near the center of campus.
Physical facilities include special laboratories
for biological anthropology, isotope and lithic
analysis, paleoecology, geoarchaeology, and
zooarchaeology, as well as research laboratories
for faculty and advanced students. The Museum
of Anthropology, with permanent and temporary
exhibits, and ethnographic and archaeological
research collections, is also housed in College Hall.
The department offers courses of study leading
to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology,
Bachelor of Arts in Human Biology, Master of
Arts in Anthropology, and Doctor of Philosophy
(Anthropology). Positions open to anthropologists
include those in teaching, research, museum work,
state and federal agencies, non-governmental
organizations, private consulting firms, and
international business. In addition, anthropology
provides a strong general foundation for a pre-
professional education.
Human Biology
Human Biology is an explicitly interdisciplinary
degree jointly administered by the Department
of Anthropology and the School of Biological
Sciences. The BA in Human Biology offers students
an opportunity to explore how human biology
influences and is influenced by the environment,
cultural and social structures, and economic and
political policies. Human Biology melds approaches
and content from social and biological sciences to
provide students with a synthetic understanding
of the roles of culture, the dynamics of natural and
social systems, and biological attributes responsible
for shaping the human being. Our aim is to prepare
students to be engaged, creative, insightful, and
skillful in diverse professions that encompass the
arenas of health and environmental sciences,
societal support, and public policy that influence
the welfare of humans.
Student Learning Outcomes
We expect that our graduating students will have:
• Broad understanding of the subfields of
archaeology, biological anthropology, cultural
anthropology, and linguistics;
• Awareness of the basic research and analytical
methods and underlying theories of the four
subfields of anthropology;
• Ability to read critically and synthesize
i n f o r m a t i o n p r o d u c e d b y p r o f e s s i o n a l
anthropologists and published in academic books
and journals;
• Holistic understanding of human biology and
cultural diversity;
• Ability to apply the principles, findings, and
analytical methods of anthropology to new
situations and data, including those of everyday life.

Washington State University, 2024
individualize their expertise by exploring minors
and supporting work in business administration,
communication, and fine arts.
An internship is required of students in both
emphasis areas. Internships are a valuable way
to gain experience and contacts in the industry
and make students more competitive when they
graduate. A large number of companies in the
U.S. and abroad offer internships in the textile and
apparel field. Internship exposures help students
better their understanding of the industry and
determine what career path is best for them.
Normally the applicant for graduate study
should have an undergraduate major in apparel,
merchandising, design, or textiles. However,
candidates with a good record in related fields (such
as business, economics, marketing, psychology,
sociology, and etc.) may be well prepared for certain
areas of advanced study. All graduate students must
show competency in their area of study (through
an undergraduate degree or industry experience)
in order to earn their degree. Please refer to WSU
Graduate catalog and web site at https://gradschool.
wsu.edu/.

The Department of Art provides a range of
experiences in the visual arts. The department offers
diverse courses of study leading to the degrees of
Bachelor of Arts in Art (within this degree, there
are three options at the undergraduate level: an
Art Studio option, and an Art History option as
BA-FA degrees, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts BFA in
studio). At the graduate level there is the terminal
degree of Master of Fine Arts (MFA). The Bachelor
of Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts programs are
designed to open doors into the world of visual
expression and intellectual development. In
particular, we encourage students to sample a
variety of art disciplines and make an informed
choice about their direction in art. The department
includes eleven areas of emphasis within which
to develop a program: ceramics, drawing, digital
media, graphic arts, integrated design, illustration,
painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture, and
interdisciplinary studies. These are supported by a
strong art history component.

Washington State University, 2024
Students with a BA in Art - Art Studio Option or
the BFA in Art, should have a broad understanding
of the visual arts with an understanding of arts-
related concepts/terms (including subject matter,
form, and content) and basic studio production,
a grounding in art history, and an awareness of
contemporary trends in art and theory. They
should be able to articulate in visual form a range
of approaches, from a representational point of view
through a more conceptual focus, make critical
judgments about contemporary art and culture,
and have an acceptable command of verbal and
written expression.
Students with a BA in Art - Art History Option are
given broad exposure to the history of the visual
arts. As an interdisciplinary field, art history is an
intellectual arena in which students develop their
perceptual skills and analytical tools to engage
diverse art forms from multiple perspectives.
Students begin with foundation survey courses,
the History of World Art (ART 201 and ART 202),
and then take upper-division courses to consider art
from specific cultures and historical time periods.
In these courses, students gain familiarity with
contextual issues concerning the production and
consumption of art. They develop research and
writing skills necessary to think critically about art
and visual culture. Students are also introduced to
basic aspects of studio production to enhance their
visual skills and knowledge of material practices.
Students complete their studies by writing a thesis
paper and developing knowledge of one foreign
language.
Student Learning Outcomes
Students graduating with the BA in Art develop:
• An ability to solve open-ended problems/
challenges of artistic expression.
• An ability to analyze the working methods of
artists and the results of their efforts in a diverse
and disciplined way.
• An ability to communicate effectively through
their artistic practice. Students will be aware of and
engaged in a thorough way with art history, critical
theory and visual culture in a way that considers
a broad cultural awareness considering both local
and/or global issues in order to make critical
judgments about contemporary are while gaining a
deeper understanding of their own personal values.
• An in-depth understanding of the visual arts, art
history, critical theory and visual culture, sufficient
to prepare them to move into a professional career
in the arts, including essential concepts and theories
of studio production in a variety of disciplines,
with a sophistication and refinement especially in
a major field.
• An ability to take risks in experimentation. This
could mean breaking from usual habits. Trying new
materials and methodologies in confirming the
direction of their work.

The School of Biological Sciences offers training
in molecular, cellular, organismal, ecology, and
evolutionary biology. The School offers Bachelor of
Science degree programs in Biology and Zoology, a
Bachelor of Arts in Human Biology in collaboration
with the Department of Anthropology, and Master
of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs in
Biology and Plant Biology. The School also offers
undergraduate minors in Zoology and Biology, and
the Certificate in Quantitative Biology, provided in
collaboration with the Department of Mathematics.
Facilities
There are modern facilities for study of molecular
and genomics, cellular biology, genetics, plant and
animal physiology, anatomy and ultrastructure,
functional morphology, ecology, molecular
systematics, behavior, ecology, environmental
biology, and evolutionary biology. The University’s
location is conducive to field studies at sites such
as the 325 hectare George E. Hudson Biological
Preserve at Smoot Hill and nearby public lands.
Special facilities include the Aquatics Phenomics
Research Center, Franceschi Microscopy and
Imaging Center, plant growth facilities, a laboratory
for bioanalysis and biotechnology with facilities for
genotyping, DNA sequencing, and genomics, the
WSU Stable Isotope Core Facility for stable isotope
analyses, and the collections of the Charles R.
Conner Museum of Natural History and the Marion
Ownbey Herbarium.
Cooperation with many other campus units
extends research opportunities. Cooperative
arrangements with faculty in units such as Molecular
Biosciences, Animal Sciences, Environment, and the
College of Veterinary Medicine are readily achieved.
Undergraduate Programs
Introductory biological sciences courses provide
background in the concepts common to life sciences
and an overview of the diversity of animals, plants,
and microorganisms. Advanced biological sciences
courses probe specific areas in depth. Undergraduate
coursework in either biology or zoology prepares
students to pursue career opportunities in ecology
and environmental biology, laboratory research and
biotechnology, human health, animal health and
welfare, plant biology, entomology, education, and
a variety of other biological specializations.
Candidates for the Bachelor of Science in Biology,
the Bachelor of Science in Zoology, or the Bachelor
of Arts in Human Biology must fulfill the University
and the College of Arts and Sciences requirements
for graduation as described elsewhere in this
catalog. Requirements for admission to the majors,
University degree requirements, and the School and
the individual degree option requirements can be
found in the individual schedules of studies for the
degree options.
We expect that students graduating with a
Bachelor of Science in Biology or Zoology will meet
the following learning outcomes: (1) demonstrate
understanding of fundamental biological concepts:
terminology, functions, processes and principles; (2)
demonstrate higher order thinking by synthesizing,
summarizing, drawing conclusions and making

84
Biological Sciences
Washington State University, 2024
arguments on biology topics and real world
applications; (3) clearly communicate scientific
research findings, concepts, and analysis, both
orally and in writing; (4) evaluate and properly cite
scientific sources; (5) formulate logical hypotheses,
select methods, and clearly present quantitative
findings from an experimental design; (6) analyze,
interpret and display quantitative data and models
to draw conclusions and explain limitations; (7)
describe multiple well-developed perspectives on a
single contemporary biological issue.
Biology
Seven options are available for the Bachelor of
Science degree in Biology: general biology, biology
education, plant biology, ecology/evolutionary
biology, entomology, pre-physical therapy/pre-
occupational therapy/pre-physician assistant, and
basic medical sciences. Each option includes a
common core curriculum, plus additional specialized
courses. The general biology option provides
broad training in the life sciences, particularly for
students seeking to continue in professional or
graduate school. The biology education option is
particularly suitable for students who would like
to teach biology at the high school level. The plant
biology option is available for students with a
special interest in plants and serves students who
would like careers in plant sciences or to pursue
graduate studies. The ecology/evolutionary biology
option provides a concentration on ecological and
evolutionary biology to address interests in such
fields as environmental and wildlife biology. The
entomology option is available for students who
wish to focus on insect biology. The pre-physical
therapy/pre-occupational therapy/pre-physician
assistant option is designed for students who
would like to pursue studies in physical therapy,
occupational therapy, or physician assistant
programs. The basic medical sciences option
supports students who aim for a career in the health
fields, including professional training in medicine,
dentistry, and pharmacy. This degree will help
students to meet the requirements for admission
to medical, dental, or pharmacy schools, or other
health science professional programs. Students
work with their academic advisor in the School of
Biological Sciences to plan individual courses of
study.
Human Biology
Human Biology is an explicitly interdisciplinary
degree jointly administered by the Department
of Anthropology and the School of Biological
Sciences. The BA in Human Biology offers students
an opportunity to explore how human biology
influences and is influenced by the environment,
cultural and social structures, and economic and
political policies. Human Biology melds approaches
and content from social and biological sciences to
provide students with a synthetic understanding
of the roles of culture, the dynamics of natural and
social systems, and biological attributes responsible
for shaping the human being. Our aim is to prepare
students to be engaged, creative, insightful, and
skillful in diverse professions that encompass the
arenas of health and environmental sciences,
societal support, and public policy that influence
the welfare of humans.
Please see the Department of Anthropology
for degree program requirements, including the
schedule of studies.
Zoology
Three options are available for the Bachelor
of Science degree in Zoology: general zoology,
pre-veterinary/animal care, and pre-medicine/
pre-dentistry. Each of these options includes a core
curriculum that provides a strong science foundation
plus additional specialized courses taken in the
program option. The flexible curriculum leading
to a zoology degree meets the needs of students
with various interests and goals. The general
zoology option provides a broad, solid foundation
in zoology. It is especially aimed at students
desiring a well-rounded background for further
professional studies or for entry into the workforce
in areas such as wildlife biology or fisheries. The
pre-medicine/pre-dentistry option is offered by the
School of Biological Sciences as a course program
designed to provide a solid academic foundation
that successfully prepares the student for admission
into medical, dental, or pharmacy school. The pre-
veterinary/animal care option prepares students for
careers involving animal care and maintenance in
research institutions, zoos, aquaria, and clinics and
for application to colleges of veterinary medicine.
Accelerated Pre-Vet Option in Zoology
The School of Biological Sciences has an academic
track that can allow highly qualified students to
earn both a Bachelor of Science in Zoology and
a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree within
a seven-year span. Students can enroll in the
undergraduate zoology program and complete all
UCORE requirements, the necessary zoology core
courses, and all veterinary medicine prerequisite
coursework in a three-year period. The required
prerequisites courses can be found on the WSU CVM
website: https://dvm.vetmed.wsu.edu/admissions/
prerequisites. Such students who are accepted into
the College of Veterinary Medicine DVM program
after completing this three-year program will then
be allowed to transfer credit back from their first
year DVM curriculum to fulfill the requirements
that will allow them to earn a BS in Zoology.
Interested students must be advised in the School
of Biological Sciences. High scholastic achievement,
along with demonstrated experience and interest
in working with animals and within the veterinary
profession, will be a few of the main criteria for
inclusion. Interested students should contact the
School of Biological Sciences no later than the first
semester of the sophomore year. Students would
then declare zoology with the pre-vet option as a
major in the first semester of the sophomore year.
The procedures for application into the DVM
program will be the same as those for all other
applicants to the program excluding those
applicants applying to the Early Acceptance
Undergraduate Programs through the Honors
College or Department of Animal Sciences.
Students in this program are not given preferential
consideration for admission into the DVM program.
Participants who complete the three-year zoology
program and are accepted into the DVM program
during their junior year, will begin the veterinary
medicine curriculum in their fourth year of study.
These students would complete only the DVM
curriculum from this point on, and credits from
the first year of the DVM program will be used to
fulfill the remaining requirements that will allow
them to earn a BS in Zoology. If the student is not
accepted into the DVM program or withdraws from
it, they may continue to earn the BS in Zoology and
may be eligible to apply to the College of Veterinary
Medicine as a senior or following completion of the
BS.
Transfer Students
Science courses taken at other institutions will
be evaluated and credits accepted when possible.
Inquiries should be directed to the Associate
Director of Undergraduate Programs.
Graduate Programs
The school awards Master of Science and Doctor
of Philosophy degrees in Biology and Plant Biology
at the graduate level. Faculty interests and research
programs are diverse, including genomics, molecular
and cellular biology, animal and plant physiology,
various aspects of organismal biology of plants and
animals, systematics, ecology, evolutionary biology,
and biology education. A list of specific faculty
interests can be obtained at https://sbs.wsu.edu/
people/ or by writing to the school. Communication
with faculty members prior to applying for the
graduate program is strongly encouraged.
Preparation for Graduate Study in Biology
and Plant Biology
Students with undergraduate majors in such fields
as animal sciences, biology, botany, cell biology,
environmental sciences, genetics, microbiology,
natural resources, plant sciences, wildlife biology,
and zoology may be prepared for graduate study in
the School of Biological Sciences.
Students who complete Master of Science and
Doctor of Philosophy degrees in our program
find careers as faculty in colleges and universities,
conservation biologists and managers of natural
resources, biologists and technicians for state
and federal agencies, specialists in informatics,
and scientists and laboratory technicians in
biotechnology and other life sciences industries.

Carson Career Amplifier Program
The Carson Career Amplifier Program (CCAP)
engages students in co-curricular activities and
programs that provide students with the opportunity
to develop professional skills and experiences that
employers are seeking. In addition to required
coursework, earning a degree in the Carson College
of Business requires students to complete several
categories of co-curricular requirements each year.
Categories are based on a subset of the National
Association of College and Employers (NACE)
Career Readiness Competencies and include:
• Communication
• Leadership
• Professionalism
• Career Management
The CCAP program helps students to develop the
professional skills needed to become business leaders
of tomorrow. With a focus on professionalism,
networking, and engagement, students will select
from a menu of online and in-person activities
that satisfy each requirement. Each year, CCAP
requirements become progressively more involved;
from learning about student success strategies in
the first year, to participating in an internship or
study abroad as a junior or senior. Details about
requirements for satisfying annual milestones can
be found on the Carson College website.
Students can expect to spend a minimum of
7-10 co-curricular hours each year, depending on
how students choose to satisfy each requirement.
However, as students become involved in leadership
activities and high impact learning experiences,
the amount of co-curricular hours will increase.
For example, over the course of one academic year,
a student attending weekly club meetings could
spend about 26 hours in club meetings, a summer

100
Business
Washington State University, 2024
internship could total 300-400 hours, and a 6-week
faculty led study abroad program averages about
250 hours.
Examples of activities that could be used to satisfy
competencies:
Communication: • Networking events •
Professional development seminars on resume/
cover letter development and interview preparation
• Mock interviews • Jobs or volunteer work that
involve public speaking.
L e a d e r s h i p : • I n c r e a s i n g c o m m i t m e n t /
involvement in clubs and organizations resulting in
the opportunity to take on leadership roles. Includes
business clubs, student government, current work,
Greek & Residence Hall leadership, community
organizations, roles such as Resident Assistant (RA)
and Research Assistant. • Structured leadership
programs/trainings • Increasing leadership
responsibilities within current employment.
Professionalism: • Activities that increase student
understanding of professional standards expected
in higher education (in and outside the classroom)
• Activities that increase student understanding
of professional standards expected by employers
(internships, relevant work experiences, business
consulting projects) • Opportunities that allow
students to strengthen and demonstrate their
professionalism and work ethic.
Career Management: • Assessing oneself
(strengths/weaknesses, interests/dislikes, abilities,
values) • Learning about majors, internships,
careers/employers, professional development
opportunities in order to make informed decisions
• Setting major/career goals based on analyzing
oneself and career opportunities • Identifying areas
within one’s skillset that need to be developed/
strengthened • Pursuing activities that strengthen
areas needing growth & development.
Options used to satisfy competency will be
based on the availability of events/activities at
each campus and Global Campus students will
have the ability to satisfy requirements through
events/activities in their surrounding community
and current employment site. If an activity/event
is not on the list, students, advisors, and faculty
will have the ability to propose additional events/
activities that align with the goals for a competency.
Each year (based on credit hours) will be tracked as
milestones in the myWSU system. Completion of
the first year of the CCAP is required for admission
into the College. Subsequent years will be tracked
annually. Completion of the CCAP for all 4 years
is required for graduation.

Schedules of Studies

College requirements which replace the
UCORE requirements.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
(120 CREDITS)
Preparation for careers with multinational
corporations, governmental and intergovernmental
agencies both domestic and international. Students
must complete a minimum of one semester of at
least 11 weeks in length and 12 transferable credits
from a pre-approved partnership program.
The International Business major requires its
students to demonstrate competency in a foreign
language. With sufficient high school preparation,
students can elect to take an online examination
upon entrance to WSU (fee based tests such as
STAMP or LTI). If additional preparation in a foreign
language is necessary, students will work with a CCB
advisor to develop an appropriate course of study.
Assessed proficiency in a second language will be
at the intermediate level or completion of a foreign
language course through the 204 level. This may
be completed at any time before graduation. Check
with an advisor for specifics. Education Abroad is
strongly recommended for language acquisition.
The following courses in any foreign language (or
any course for which one of these is a prerequisite)
will be accepted as meeting the foreign language
competency standard set by International Business
in the Carson College of Business: 204, 261, 306,
307, 308, 406, 407, or 408.
This requirement is for all students except
international students whose primary language is
not English. A third language is strongly encouraged
for students who have achieved competency in two
languages by the time they enter the university or
are admitted to the major.
In addition to completing international business
courses, students will gain marketable skills by
choosing a concentration area or a double major
within the Carson College of Business (CCB).
Students choosing to complete a concentration area
must take 3 classes (9 credits) in one of the following
areas: Global Trade, Sustainable Development,
Entrepreneurship, Finance, Hospitality Business
Management, Management Information Systems,
Management, or Marketing (see course options
for each concentration area in footnotes below).
Students interested in pursuing a double-major
can do so in the following business majors:
Accounting, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Human
Resources Management, or Marketing. Students
pursuing double majors must complete at least
15 additional credits (18 credits for accounting)
from courses specifically required by the second
major and distinct from those used to satisfy the
International Business major.
Students majoring in International Business are
also encouraged to pursue areas of expertise, such
as in Business Economics, a double major in foreign
language for the professions such as Chinese,
French, German, or Spanish for the Professions, in
Political Sciences, or pursue the Certificate in East
Asian Studies for Business majors.
Additional majors within the Business
Administration Degree
Students already admitted to another major
within the Business Administration degree, except
for the Business Administration major, can elect
to earn an additional major in International
Business by completing the following courses and
requirements: I BUS 280, I BUS 453, I BUS 480, 3
credits of ECONS 327 or I BUS 470, the Foreign
Language Requirement2, and the Study Abroad
Requirement6. None of the courses for an additional
major may be used for a 300-400-level Business
Elective and at least 15 credits of an additional
major’s courses cannot be used elsewhere in the
degree. If interested in this option, please contact a
Carson College of Business advisor.

refer, and model professional behaviors prepare our
graduates for the professional world.
The school offers courses of study leading to the
degrees of Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering,
Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering,
Master of Science in Chemical Engineering, and
Doctor of Philosophy, with a focus in chemical
engineering. We also graduate students who receive
the Master of Science in Engineering and the Doctor
of Philosophy in Engineering Science with an
emphasis in bioengineering.
Chemical Engineering
The curriculum in chemical engineering
provides thorough knowledge of basic science and
engineering. This includes material and energy
balances, chemical and physical equilibria, rate
processes, and economic balances. With such
training, graduates may participate in the design
and operation of chemically based products or they
may engage in research leading to new or improved
chemical processes, products, and uses. Graduates
also find rewarding work in plant operation, plant
management, university teaching, sales-service, and
other functions requiring chemical engineering
training. Many students also use their educations
in chemical engineering as preparation for other
professional degrees such as medicine or law. The
chemical engineering program is accredited by the
Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,
www.abet.org.
Student Learning Outcomes
To guide our student activities in developing
the skills to meet the School’s objectives we will
monitor their attainment of the Student Outcomes
as set forth by ABET. These are: 1) an ability to
identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering
problems by applying principles of engineering,
science, and mathematics, 2) an ability to apply
engineering design to produce solutions that
meet specified needs with consideration of public
health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural,
social, environmental, and economic factors, 3) an
ability to communicate effectively with a range
of audiences, 4) an ability to recognize ethical
and professional responsibilities in engineering
situations and make informed judgments, which
must consider the impact of engineering solutions
in global, economic, environmental, and societal
contexts, 5) an ability to function effectively on a
team whose members together provide leadership,
create a collaborative and inclusive environment,
establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives,
6) an ability to develop and conduct appropriate
experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and
use engineering judgment to draw conclusions, and
7) an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as
needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
In addition to these Outcomes we will also monitor
the program criteria for chemical, biochemical,
biomolecular or similarly named engineering
programs, as set forth by the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). These criteria are,
respectively: “The curriculum must provide (1) a
thorough grounding in the basic sciences including
chemistry, physics, and biology, with some content
at an advanced level, as appropriate to the objectives
of the program. The curriculum must include (2)
the engineering application of these basic sciences
to the design, analysis, and control of chemical,
physical, and/or biological processes, including the
hazards associated with these processes.” (Numerals
added to original AIChE statement).

Bioengineering
Bioengineering is an engineering discipline that
integrates engineering and life sciences to address
issues important to human and animal well-being
and to society at large. As such, the educational
objective of the BS Bioengineering degree is to
prepare graduates for productive employment,
advanced study, or professional programs where
they apply principles and methods of both
engineering and life sciences to solve problems
affecting human and animal health and well-being.
Graduates may apply their expertise in human and
animal medicine, biotechnology, or related biology-
based engineering fields.
With these integrated science and engineering
skills, bioengineering graduates are able to make
valuable contributions to human and animal
health care and environments, bio-based product
development, and biotechnology. At Washington
State University, bioengineering cooperates with
and finds applications in numerous disciplines
of engineering, veterinary medicine, and medical
sciences. The bioengineering curriculum easily
accommodates pre-medical, pre-dental, and pre-
veterinary requirements for those students wishing
to apply to professional schools in health care fields.
The bioengineering program is accredited by the
Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,
www.abet.org.

Chemistry is the fundamental science of matter, the
nature of substances, and the changes occurring in
them. Chemical reactions are the basis of all life
on earth. Everything we are or do depends in one
way or another on chemistry. A major in chemistry
prepares you for a variety of careers in industry,
education, and public service, or for graduate study
and research in chemistry and many related fields.
The department has excellent facilities and special
equipment for study and research at both the
undergraduate and graduate level. There are active
research programs in both traditional and emerging
areas of chemistry. For example, the department
is an integral partner in The PNNL-WSU Nuclear
Science and Technology Institute, with participating
faculty from nearly all research areas noted below.
Students in chemistry at WSU are encouraged to
take advantage of its excellent facilities and faculty
by beginning research projects as early as possible.
Research expands experience beyond the classroom
into the realm of new knowledge.
Typical areas for research include:
• Analytical chemistry research spans fundamental
developments in instrumentation, synthetic
methodologies, molecular recognition and other
strategies used in separations science. These
methodologies are frequently used by our faculty
to understand the migration of species through
biological and environmental systems.
• Inorganic chemistry has as its center the study
of the vast majority of the known elements
and especially the transition metals; it includes
development of catalysts for organic and inorganic
transformations and investigation of the properties
of organometallic compounds, investigation of
the bioinorganic of metal containing proteins
and radiopharmaceuticals, as well as inorganic
radiochemical research on separation methods for
lanthanides and actinides.
• Materials chemistry brings the knowledge and
understanding of chemistry to the study of the
structure and properties of materials. It involves
the study of chemical reactions and physical
processes occurring at surfaces and in solids by both
experimental and theoretical means. It includes
important phenomena such as energy transfer in
light absorbing and emitting materials, electrical
and heat transport in solids, and extends to the
synthesis of new and improved materials, including
nanomaterials.
• Organic chemistry deals with the many
compounds of carbon and how these compounds
interact in biological systems. It includes the
study of medicinal, bioorganic, mechanistic, and
synthetic chemistry and how these areas may
be used in areas such elucidation of metabolic
pathways, drug development in the treatment of
diseases, and environmentally benign synthesis of
important chemicals.
• Physical chemistry applies the methods and
theories of physics to the study of chemical,
biological, and nanoscale materials. It involves
theoretical studies of chemical bonding using
advanced computational methods and the
investigation of the structures of solids and surfaces
by a variety of instrumental methods including
photon spectroscopies, X-ray techniques, and
surface characterization. It also expands our
understanding of molecular scale mechanisms
for kinetically and thermodynamically driven
processes.
Degrees and Options
The Department of Chemistry is on the approved
list of the American Chemical Society and offers
courses of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of
Science in Chemistry, with options in professional
chemistry or materials chemistry. Both of these
options lead to a degree for which students will
be well prepared for entry into the workforce
or to pursue a graduate degree. The department
also offers a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry with a
standard option and a teacher preparation option.
In addition, graduate study programs leading to
the Master of Science in Chemistry and Doctor of
Philosophy (Chemistry) are also offered.
After the beginning of the first year, a student
interested in majoring in chemistry should consult
with chemistry advisors to arrange a schedule
which will permit completion of required courses
in proper sequence. Regardless of which degree or
option is chosen, a grade of C or better is required
in all chemistry courses to fulfill requirements for
the chemistry degree.
A student beginning undergraduate work will
begin with CHEM 105. Students without high
school chemistry will begin their study with CHEM
103 prior to taking CHEM 105. Additionally, if a
student has completed one year of Advanced
Placement high school chemistry and has scored 5
on the Advanced Placement Exam, credit is granted
for the CHEM 105 / 106 sequence. If a student has
completed one year of advanced placement high
school chemistry and has scored 3 or 4 on the
Advanced Placement Exam, credit is granted for
CHEM 105. Students who complete an International
Baccalaureate program with a high level pass and
a grade of 4 or more on the exam are given credit
for CHEM 101.
The Department of Chemistry provides major
parts of the course work leading to degrees in
the School of Molecular Biosciences. Students
whose interests span chemistry and biology or
chemistry and physics should see the section on
the appropriate program in this catalog.
Lab Fees
Charges for expendable laboratory supplies and
computing are made in each laboratory course.
Student Learning Outcomes for the B.S.
Students graduating from the Chemistry
Department will be able to demonstrate:
• A thorough knowledge of the basic principles
of chemistry, including atomic and molecular
structure, chemical dynamics and the chemical and
physical properties of substances.
• A thorough knowledge of the subfields of
chemistry, including analytical, inorganic, organic,
biochemistry, and physical chemistry.
• The ability to read, critically evaluate and
interpret numerical, chemical and general scientific
information.
• The ability to communicate effectively about
chemistry both verbally and in writing.
• The ability to design experiments and to use
appropriate experimental apparatus effectively.

CIVIL ENGINEERING
Civil engineers plan, design, construct, and
operate the physical works and facilities essential
to modern life. Civil engineers are responsible
not only for creating the facilities required by
a modern civilization, but also are committed
to the conservation and preservation of the
environment. Examples of these facilities include
bridges, highways, buildings, airports, flood control
structures, purification plants for drinking water,
waste treatment and disposal facilities, offshore
structures, tunnels, irrigation systems, space
satellites, and launching facilities.
The program leading to the Bachelor of Science
degree in Civil Engineering (BSCE) is accredited
by the Engineering Accreditation Commission
of ABET, www.abet.org, which is the nonprofit,
non-governmental organization that accredits
college and university programs in the disciplines
of applied science, computing, engineering, and
engineering technology.
The mission of the BSCE program of the
Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering is to provide a premier undergraduate
education in civil engineering that prepares our
graduates to contribute effectively to the profession
and society, for advanced study, and for life-long
learning; to conduct world-class disciplinary and
interdisciplinary research that is integrated with
both graduate and undergraduate education in
selected areas of excellence; and to serve a diverse
constituency through technology transfer, public
service, and outreach.
Student Learning Outcomes
The learning outcomes of the civil engineering
undergraduate program are the following:
• An ability to identify, formulate and solve
complex engineering problems by applying
principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
• An ability to apply engineering design to
produce solutions that meet specified needs with
consideration of public health, safety, and welfare,
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental,
and economic factors.
• An ability to communicate effectively with a
range of audiences.
• An ability to recognize ethical and professional
responsibilities in engineering situations and
make informed judgments, which must consider
the impact of engineering solutions in global,
economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
• An ability to function effectively on a team
whose members together provide leadership, create
a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish
goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
• An ability to develop and conduct appropriate
experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and
use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
• An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as
needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
The objectives for graduates of our BSCE program
are as follows: 1) that they engage in entry-level
engineering or related employment or advanced
education; 2) that they demonstrate competence
and ongoing development in their technical
and professional skills; 3) that they demonstrate
continued growth in effective communication;
4) that they pursue their careers with integrity,
service, and professionalism; and 5) that they
continue learning and they grow into positions of
responsibility.
Courses can be selected to provide in-depth
studies in environmental, infrastructure, water
resource, and structural engineering.
Because design and planning are essential in the
civil engineering profession, these activities are
introduced in early C E courses. As students advance,
they face open-ended assignments with alternative
solutions, feasibility studies, safety considerations,
economics, social and environmental impacts, and
other concerns that test their creative ability. All
students complete a senior capstone design class
in which much of earlier course work is applied.

Civil and Environmental Engineering
Washington State University, 2024
All seniors are encouraged to take the
Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam prior to
graduation. Two purposes of this exam are: (1) It is
a required step in becoming a licensed professional
engineer; and (2) It serves as an assessment tool for
meeting the department’s objectives.
Because of the ever-increasing knowledge
required to practice at high levels of competence
in the specialized branches of civil engineering, an
educational preparation of five or more years of
college study is becoming more important. By an
appropriate choice of electives the undergraduate
curriculum may be integrated with a graduate
program to provide a continuous schedule of studies
leading to both the bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
The department offers courses of study leading
to the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Civil
Engineering, Master of Science in Civil Engineering,
Master of Science in Environmental Engineering,
and Doctor of Philosophy (Civil Engineering). The
department also participates in interdepartmental
programs leading to the degrees of Master of Science
in Environmental Science, and Master of Regional
Planning.
CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING
Construction engineering focuses on the design
and construction processes required to produce
facilities and systems that are essential to modern
life and infrastructure. The program leading to
the Bachelor of Science degree in Construction
Engineering (BSConE) gives its graduates thorough
training in fundamental engineering principles
along with the practical business and management
concepts necessary for construction professionals.
The program covers many aspects of the built
environment such as bridges, roads, harbors,
airports, industrial facilities, and many others.
The mission of the BSConE program of the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
is to provide a premier undergraduate education
in construction engineering that prepares our
graduates to contribute effectively to the profession
and society, for advanced study, and for life-long
learning; to conduct world-class disciplinary and
interdisciplinary research that is integrated with
both graduate and undergraduate education in
selected areas of excellence; and to serve a diverse
constituency through technology transfer, public
service, and outreach.
Student Learning Outcomes
The learning outcomes of the construction
engineering undergraduate program are the
following:
• An ability to identify, formulate and solve
complex engineering problems by applying
principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
• An ability to apply engineering design to
produce solutions that meet specified needs with
consideration of public health, safety, and welfare,
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental,
and economic factors.
• An ability to communicate effectively with a
range of audiences.
• An ability to recognize ethical and professional
responsibilities in engineering situations and
make informed judgments, which must consider
the impact of engineering solutions in global,
economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
• An ability to function effectively on a team
whose members together provide leadership, create
a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish
goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
• An ability to develop and conduct appropriate
experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and
use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
• An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as
needed, using appropriate learning strategies
The objectives for graduates of our BSConE program
are as follows: 1) that they engage in entry-level
construction, engineering, or related employment
or advanced education; 2) that they demonstrate
competence and ongoing development in their
technical and professional skills; 3) that they
demonstrate continued growth in effective
communication; 4) that they pursue their careers
with integrity, service, and professionalism; and
5) that they continue learning as they grow into
positional of managerial responsibility.
Courses can be selected to provide specialization
tracks in environmental facilities, foundations/
heavy civil, general civil, infrastructure/pavement,
and structures. All students complete a senior
capstone design class in which much of earlier
course work is applied. All seniors are encouraged
to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam
prior to graduation since this a required step in
becoming a licensed professional engineer.
The department offers a course of study leading to
the degree of Bachelor of Science in Construction
Engineering (BSConE).
Computer Requirement
All incoming Civil and Environmental Engineering
and Construction Engineering students are required
to purchase laptop computers. Please contact the

Transfer Students
Students who are planning to transfer to civil
or construction engineering at Washington
State University from other institutions should
coordinate their program with the department
chairperson to establish an integrated program
leading to the bachelor’s degree. Inquiries
concerning specific questions are welcome. A
strong preparation in mathematics and physics is
necessary prior to transfer to minimize the time
required to complete the degree requirements. The
requirements for direct entry into the Department
of Civil and Environmental Engineering upon
transfer are the same as listed for admission to the
major under the Degree Programs. The Admissions
Office will handle admissions applications from
transfer students and the Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering will handle admission
to the major applications.
Preparation for Graduate Study
As preparation for academic work toward
an advanced degree in civil engineering or
environmental engineering, a student should
have completed substantially the equivalent of
the schedule of studies. For details on specific
requirements for the various areas of specialty, visit

Program in Data Analytics
data-analytics.wsu.edu
Neil 103
509-335-3736
Director and Professor, N. Dasgupta (Pullman)
Data analytics is the application of powerful
new methods—drawn from computer science,
mathematics and statistics, and domain sciences—to
collect, curate, analyze, discover and communicate
knowledge from “big data.”
There has been an explosion of demand for
skilled data analysts who can communicate, solve
problems, and work effectively in teams. Data
analytics tools and techniques are used by many
different industries to create, manage, explore, and
analyze large, complex datasets in order to evaluate
past performance, predict future trends, and make
better decisions.
Our students are trained in advanced statistical,
data, and computer science skills as well as
concentrated domain knowledge. This combination
enables WSU graduates to effectively work in teams
and easily communicate with colleagues and
managers to solve problems.
The ten specialization concentrations, including
the General concentration, are curricular
partnerships between the College of Arts and
Sciences and the Voiland College of Engineering and
Architecture, Carson College of Business, College of
Education, and the College of Agriculture, Human,
and Natural Resource Sciences.
Students graduating with a BS in Data
Analytics from WSU will be able to:
• Understand data and its analysis in theory (using
computing, mathematical and statistical principles),
in practice (computing methods, software, analysis,
coding) throughout the data lifecycle.
• Understand the context of the data, domain it
comes from, type of data, questions of interest and
apply methods to solve them.
• Recognize professional responsibilities as
data analysts: understand ethical and legal
responsibilities regarding the data one has access
to; understand the concepts of security and privacy
of data; have confidence in these principles to
articulate misuse and abuse of data.
• Effectively communicate (verbally, written
and visual) in a variety of professional contexts,
understanding and appreciating their audience.
• Function effectively as a member or leader of
a team engaged in activities appropriate to data
analytics.
Schedules of Studies
Honors students complete the Honors
College requirements which replace the

The School of Design and Construction (SDC) offers
collaborative learning experiences for students in
architecture, interior design, landscape architecture,
construction management, and construction
engineering to design and construct places in
our environment. The integrated model teaches
students the skill sets required for their chosen
design major while giving students a substantial
advantage when entering the job market.
Programs of study in the SDC lead to the following
degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Architectural
Studies (a four-year pre-professional degree) followed
by a one-, two-, or three-year professional Master
of Architecture degree that is accredited by the
National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB);
a Bachelor of Arts in Interior Design accredited by
the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA)
and a Master of Arts in Interior Design ; a Bachelor of
Landscape Architecture accredited by the Landscape
Architecture Accreditation Board (LAAB) ; and a
Bachelor of Science in Construction Management (a
four-year degree) that is accredited by the American
Council for Construction Education (ACCE).
Further, the undergraduate degrees in architectural
studies, landscape architecture, and construction
management, as well as the graduate degree in
architecture, are STEM designated
It is crucial that students in the design and
construction professions learn about a range of
built environments, places, ideas, cultures, and
experiences that are not readily available in the
Palouse—and difficult to teach in the classroom.
When possible, travel experiences are incorporated
through courses labeled as “study tours” where
travel is integral to the course, woven throughout
other courses in the curriculum, and included as
professional development activities.
Study abroad may be incorporated into the
fourth year of study or during the summer. Foreign
studies options include WSU sponsored programs,
and programs offered by other institutions.
Coordination is through the Office of International
Programs—Global Learning.
Students in the SDC also participate in a
senior portfolio review and/or capstone project
presentation prior to graduation. These experiences
are unique networking opportunities for graduating
students to interact with design and construction
professionals, and to receive feedback on their
existing portfolios or projects.
A variety of student clubs and organizations
provide students with linkages to their professional
counterparts. Student organizations with chapters
at the SDC include the American Institute of
Architecture Students (AIAS); Alpha Rho Chi;
American Society of Interior Designers (ASID);
American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA);
Associated Students of Construction Management
(ASCM); Associated General Contractors of America
(AGC); the Design Build Institute of America (DBIA);
and Mechanical Contractors Association of America
(MCAA).
UNDERGRADUATE MINORS
The School of Design and Construction offers
minors in Architectural Studies, Construction
Management, Interior Design, and Landscape
Architecture. Students may apply to add one or
more of these minors after they are admitted to a
major.
CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS
The School of Design and Construction offers the
Energy Conscious Construction (ECC) certificate
through the Global and Pullman campuses at
both the undergraduate and graduate level. The
ECC certificate is an interdisciplinary program in
building science and focused on high-performing
energy-efficient residential building design and
construction.
ARCHITECTURE
The four-year, pre-professional Bachelor of Science
in Architectural Studies degree at WSU is STEM
designated and provides a thorough foundation in
the field of architecture as preparation for continued
education in a professional degree program;
employment in the architecture profession; and
employment options in fields related to architecture.
The Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degree is
the professional degree accredited by the National
Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and is STEM
designated. Completion of this degree satisfies
the educational requirement of the pathway to
architectural licensure in all U.S. Jurisdictions.
Students must successfully complete a four-year
undergraduate degree in architecture or a previous
five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree to be
eligible for the one- or two-year M.Arch. program.
Students with baccalaureate degrees in disciplines
other than architecture are eligible to apply for the
three-year M.Arch. program. Please consult the WSU
Graduate Catalog and/or http://sdc.wsu.edu/ for
specific information regarding this degree, as well
as admission requirements and course descriptions.
Student Learning Outcomes
Students graduating in architecture are able to: 1)
understand the role of architecture within current
cultural and global conditions, 2) understand
the role of architecture in the enhancement and
preservation of natural resources, 3) understand
the role of history and its transformations over
time, 4) develop a desire and passion for life-long
learning, and 5) develop intellectual and analytical
skills that will be the foundation for future leaders.
It is the intent of the program to graduate future
professionals who are committed to excellence in
the built environment through the incorporation
of intellectual, analytical, and artful aspects of
architecture. Within this context, students and
faculty seek to investigate issues within diverse
contexts in order to creatively advance the built
environment.
Transfer Students
Students planning to transfer into the
architecture program at Washington State University
should contact an advisor for more information.
CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
The management of construction projects has
become more complex due to the shortage of
resources, specialized materials, sophisticated
delivery methods and the financial and legal
responsibilities encountered during the project life
cycle. From construction management to project
management and program management, the
needs of the industry and the built environment
are expanding at an unprecedented rate. At the
heart of the building process is the construction
professional.
The WSU Construction Management (CM)
program provides students with the tools and
skills necessary to develop strong administrative,
leadership and management expertise to be
successful in today’s construction industry. Students
pursuing a degree in construction management will
be expected to understand a wide variety of topics
that make up the built environment. This expertise
includes understanding properties of materials and
construction systems required for the construction
professional. Concepts regarding contract
administration, sustainability, risk management,
estimating and scheduling are critical skills.
Students in this program are encouraged to
develop an inquisitive and inventive mind to
understand management techniques, methods, and
sequencing. It is also important that the graduate
in construction management be knowledgeable
in the field of business. Courses offered in a
variety of departments are required to ensure
this breadth of understanding. The Bachelor of
Science in Construction Management degree
program is accredited by the American Council
for Construction Education (ACCE) and is STEM
designated.

Student Learning Outcomes
The mission of WSU-CM is to educate, prepare
and provide opportunities for students to become
valuable resources to our economy, the construction
management profession, and the built environment.
ACCE requirements establish seventeen (17)
pre-defined student learning outcomes that are
comprehensive in nature. These measurable
outcomes are introduced, reinforced, and assessed
throughout the CM curriculum in an effort to
ensure students are entering the construction
industry with appropriate foundational knowledge
and requisite skills to be work ready, day one. Upon
graduating from an accredited ACCE bachelor’s
degree program, a graduate shall be able to:

INTERIOR DESIGN
Accredited by the Council for Interior Design
Accreditation (CIDA), the Bachelor of Arts in
Interior Design is a professional degree program
that provides the common body of knowledge
related to interior design as recognized by CIDA.
The interior design program is based on a concern
for human beings and the creation of interior
settings that support human activities and values.
The curriculum is structured to create unique
learning experiences each semester. Studios focus
on a multitude of design theories rooted in a variety
of relevant disciplines. Lecture course content is
integrated into the studio experience to reinforce
specified skills and knowledge. With increasing
challenge and complexity, multidisciplinary
exposure and experiences continue throughout
the curriculum to inform design solutions as
well as prepare students to work with a myriad of
professionals upon graduation.
Professional/Global Experience
The WSU Interior Design program values
experiential learning as an important component
of a student’s education. In addition to travel
experiences throughout the curriculum, all fourth-
year students must present their portfolio of creative
work at an off-campus review to graduate.
In the fall semester of the fourth year, students will
participate in a professional, interdisciplinary, and/
or global experience, choosing one of the following
options:
• Option 1: Internship—students can choose to
complete a 5-credit internship and are encouraged
to seek opportunities beyond the region.
• Option 2: Study Abroad—students can choose
to participate in the department’s study abroad
program providing them an opportunity to
experience design within the context of another
culture.
• Option 3: Community Studio—students can
work with faculty on community-based projects
oftentimes in interdisciplinary teams.
Student Learning Outcomes
A graduate of the interior design program is a
creative thinker and problem solver. An education in
interior design develops intellectual curiosity, which
supports continued professional development
throughout life. Students develop skills that allow
them to analyze information, evaluate issues, and set
priorities while generating creative design solutions
for projects of a complex scale. As graduates of
WSU’s Interior Design program, students can take
the initiative, make critical judgments of their own
designs, as well as others, and operate within a team
context; all of which contributes to their future
success as professionals.
Transfer Students
Students wishing to transfer from another
institution into the interior design program should
contact an advisor for more information.
Graduate Studies
The Master of Arts in Interior Design (MA)
program increases students’ understanding of the
relationship between human behavior and interior
environments through advanced study and hands-
on research. Students gain knowledge and skills
that prepare them to analyze information and
relationships, evaluate issues, and set priorities,
while creating functional and high-quality design
solutions for complex projects. The degree is offered
in three tracks depending on prior academic and
professional background. Please consult the WSU
Graduate catalog and/or http://sdc.wsu.edu for
specific information regarding this degree, as well
as admission requirements and course descriptions.
LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE
Landscape architecture involves designing and
implementing opportunities for people to engage
with their environment. It is an interdisciplinary
field dedicated to crafting meaningful places across
diverse scales and contexts.
The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) is
a STEM designated professional degree program
that prepares students to enter and advance the
diverse profession of landscape architecture, address
complex societal issues, and envision solutions that
optimize the physical environments where people
work, live, and recreate.
The BLA curriculum is structured to create unique
learning experiences each semester. Broadly
speaking, the curriculum emphasizes practical
and applied experiential learning, draws from
courses across campus, and provides students
with opportunities to think critically and integrate
diverse bodies of knowledge. The professional
course of study is divided into two segments: pre-
landscape architecture and the second – fourth year
professional landscape architecture program (BLA).
Completion of the program leads to the degree of
Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and allows
the graduate to enter the profession. At least three
additional years of professional experience and
successful completion of the landscape architectural
license examination (LARE) are necessary for
registration as a licensed landscape architect in
most states.
The core component of the landscape architecture
curriculum is the studio experience. The studios are
structured to facilitate understanding of the web
of relationships among physical, biological, and
social systems. Through the studio curriculum
students learn habits of linking ecological processes
with space making and necessarily consider
interdependence, reciprocity, and change.
First year projects focus on the basic elements
and principles of design and design process. The
second year emphasizes the concept of site and the
methods for and consequences of manipulating
the ground and vegetation. Coursework includes
site design, site engineering, plant materials, and
design history. The third year reinforces and extends
students’ understanding of the field of landscape
architecture and emphasizes integration of theory,
practice, and construction. Studios focus on design
for communities in the broadest sense. In the fourth
year, coursework emphasizes design in the context
of landscape complexity, systems thinking, and
the overlap of global and local issues. Students
develop independent projects. In the projects they
are encouraged to think of design as an answer to a
question and regard their work as an opportunity to
develop, test, and challenge what they have learned
in the first three years of their design education.
Computer visualization and freehand drawing skills
are threaded throughout the curriculum.
In addition to travel experiences throughout the
curriculum, all fourth-year students must present
their capstone project and a portfolio of creative
work at an off-campus review to graduate.
Student Learning Outcomes
The program has identified five themes that include
15 critical student learning outcomes (SLO) essential
for students to achieve the LA program goals. The
outcomes are multifaceted and interrelated.
Theme One: Define and refine design problems and
questions in the context of 21
st 
century realities.
Upon successful completion of the BLA at WSU,
students will be able to:

advanced statistical and mathematical models,
preparing them for careers involving data analytics
or for advanced degrees -- such as a Master of Science
or Ph.D. in economics, agricultural economics, or
related field.
In all options, students combine course work in
economic sciences with courses outside the School
of Economic Sciences. According to their individual
interests, students supplement their economic
sciences training with elective coursework in many
areas including agricultural sciences, business,
computer science, engineering, environmental
science, history, mathematics, philosophy, political
science, and statistics.
The School of Economic Sciences also advises
the college-wide Agricultural and Food Business
Economics major. This major focuses on agricultural
business with an emphasis in economics. Please
visit http://afs.wsu.edu for more information.
Student Learning Outcomes
Graduates from the School of Economic Sciences
will evaluate and apply economic concepts and
quantitative methods; will think critically, integrate
concepts, and evaluate results in performing
economic analyses; and will communicate
effectively. Students will be able to apply economic
concepts, together with quantitative methods and
technical information relating to the decision
environment, to assist policy makers and target
groups in evaluating economic trade-offs and in
making rational economic decisions. Graduates will
also be capable of analyzing and evaluating broad
economic and social problems concerning the
allocation of individual, firm and social resources
within their specific degree interest area. Students
will be capable of communicating the results of
economic analyses in a clear, compelling, and
informative manner.
A wide variety of courses is available to non-
majors who want to take selected courses to
support their programs in other departments.
Students from other departments may declare
a minor in economics, agribusiness economics,
business economics, environmental and resource
economics and management, or sustainable
development (see below).
The school advises for the interdisciplinary
sustainable development minor that addresses
how economic and social systems interact with
major resource and environmental issues, both
internationally and domestically. This is an
interdisciplinary program with participation by the
departments such as Anthropology, Architecture,
Economics, International Business, Political Science,
the School of the Environment, and Sociology. The
program is built on the premise that as a society
we have a responsibility to ourselves and to future
generations to steward resources in ways that foster
long-term environmental and socio-cultural health
and economic viability for all peoples.
Transfer Students
Students planning to transfer to Washington
State University from other institutions should
take courses that meet the 100- and 200-level
course requirements in economics, mathematics,
accounting, English, communication, and
University Common Requirements (UCORE).
Students planning to transfer into economic sciences
by the end of their sophomore year should have
satisfactorily completed the required introductory
economics, statistics, and mathematics courses if
they plan to complete the required work for a degree
in two additional years.
Preparation for Graduate Study
Students planning to pursue graduate study in
economics or agricultural economics are urged to
select the quantitative economic option and consult
with a faculty member in the School of Economic
Sciences. All options, however, prepare students for
graduate school but are less quantitatively focused.
Students planning graduate study are advised to
develop strong skills through courses in English
composition, and additional work in statistics and
mathematics. Coursework recommendations for
specific graduate areas include:
• Law School: ACCTG 230; B LAW 210; PHIL 103,
201; POL S 300; and, depending on legal interests,
elective Econ courses from the following: ECONS
322, 324, 327, 425, 451; B LAW 411 suggested.
• Business School: ACCTG 230, 231; MIS 250.
Additional courses in business are not required for
admission to most graduate schools of business.
It might be useful, however, to take introductory
courses in the major areas of business: B LAW 210,
FIN 325, MGTOP 340, MKTG 360, ECONS 352 and
ECONS 452.
• Economics and Agricultural Economics: MATH
171 and 220 are recommended to satisfy the major’s
math requirements. MATH 172, 273, STAT 360 are
also useful. A good grade in courses such as ECONS
301, 302, 311 (B+ or higher) and in electives such
as ECONS 424 or 425 is also expected for students
seeking to be admitted to MS and PhD programs in
Economics and Agricultural Economics.
• Public Administration: ACCTG 230 and POL S
340; MIS 250 and POL S 443, 446 recommended.
Elective: ECONS 322.
Employment Opportunities
The undergraduate program provides the basic
knowledge and tools necessary to secure professional
positions in a wide range of industries and public
organizations. Some students take graduate work
to broaden their career opportunities. School of
Economics Sciences graduates compete favorably
for jobs in government, business, and non-
governmental organizations, using their strong
analytical skills to offer a different perspective for
problem-solving and decision-making. Recent
graduates have been employed in finance, banking,
agribusiness, industry, internet-based companies,
non-profit organizations, government agencies,
and at universities. Many are working in foreign
countries.
Graduate Programs
The Master of Applied Economics degree program
trains students to be industry leaders in quantitative
economic analysis. Students will graduate with
strong knowledge and skills in economic analysis,

184
Economic Sciences
Washington State University, 2024
applied econometrics, and data analytics. The
degree includes courses that teach machine learning
and data science. Students will enhance their skills
in communicating economic findings based on
investigations of data to industry-type audiences.
Students in this program should expect to find
employment in private corporations, government,
consulting, banks, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and related entities.
The Master of Science in Economics provides
specialization and research experience appropriate
for positions in private corporations and government
service as management specialists, policy analysts,
forecasters or economic consultants. Students may
also use this degree to prepare for doctoral studies in
economics or related fields. Students can focus their
studies on general economics, business economics
or agribusiness, or environmental and resource
economics by selecting supporting and elective
courses.
The School of Economic Sciences offers two
doctoral programs – the Ph.D. in Economics
and the Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics. Both
degrees prepare students for careers as professional
economists in academic, government, international
organizations, or the private sector. The program
provides students with an excellent foundation in
the theory and methods of economics along with
applications in their choice of at least two Ph.D.
fields. To further strengthen their quantitative
training, students may simultaneously pursue a
Master of Science in Statistics.

Electrical Engineering
The curriculum in electrical engineering
is designed to give the student fundamental
knowledge in the areas of general interest to
all electrical engineers. The course of study is
therefore oriented toward the basic theory and
concepts which prepare students for entry into
any of the many activities open to members of the
profession including research, design, development,
operations, management, teaching, sales, and
consulting. Laboratory experience is emphasized
to provide familiarity with electrical, electronic
and computing equipment and with experimental
techniques. Modern laboratories are available
for electrical circuits, electronics, power systems,
wireless communications, and computers. Students
are exposed to a variety of up-to-date computing
environments to aid in their studies.
The curriculum is designed so that the equivalent
of the first three to four semesters may be transferred
from community colleges with minimal difficulty.
The additional basic material common to all
branches of electrical engineering is concentrated

Majors in English provide students with a broad
critical and cultural understanding of literature
and literary studies, and emphasize the writing
and analytical skills that are vital to success in the
university, in professional and graduate school, and
in the workplace. The program of study is flexible
and allows English majors to focus on particular
areas of intellectual interest, to pursue electives,
minors, certificates, and second majors in other
departments, and to shape their academic careers
in line with professional and personal interests.
The curriculum is designed for (1) students who
desire a broad education emphasizing language
and literature, (2) students who wish to teach or to
prepare for graduate studies in literature or rhetoric
and composition, (3) students who intend to use
the background and skills learned in the major as
a foundation for careers in writing, editing, law,
business, or public service and public relations.
The curriculum provides majors the opportunity
to complete their studies with a small discussion
seminar, internship, or senior project in their area
of emphasis.
Students who are preparing to teach English in the
public schools of Washington should examine the
summary of requirements for majors and minors
listed in the Department of Teaching and Learning
in this catalog, and they should confer with the
College of Education concerning the requirements
for certification.
The Department of English offers courses of study
leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master
of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy (English). The
department participates in the interdepartmental
program in American Studies leading to the
degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy
(American Studies). The department also
administers the Program in Women’s, Gender, and
Sexuality Studies (WGSS), offering interdisciplinary
courses of study leading to the Bachelor of Arts
degree in its field. Students interested in this field
should consult the requirements listed under WGSS.
Students may also complete an English degree
consisting, in part, of international literature,
philosophy, art, architecture, and music courses
from the Humanities sequence offered jointly by
the School of Languages, Cultures, and Race and the
Department of English, within the Literary Studies
option described below.
English Major Options
Six options are offered for the English major, all
leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English:
Literary Studies is for students who desire a general
liberal arts education emphasizing literature, critical
thinking, and writing; and for those preparing for
graduate education in English or literary studies.
English is often selected as a major by students with
double majors or minors in other departments.
Rhetoric and Professional Writing is for students
preparing for careers in business, public service,
law, or other professions requiring writing and
reading skills. It is also suitable for those seeking
careers in higher education specializing in rhetoric
and composition.
Teaching is for students who seek specific training
in the teaching of language and literature at
the secondary level; it is coordinated with the
Department of Teaching and Learning.
Creative Writing is for students interested in
creative writing in various forms (poetry, fiction,
nonfiction prose), in editing and publishing, and in
careers drawing on related creative and professional
skills.
Integrative English Studies is for students interested
in integrating courses from the above three options.
Linguistics is for students interested in languages,
types of linguistic structure, and theories of
linguistic analysis.
Student Learning Outcomes
A graduate in English studies is a creative and
critical thinker and writer. An education in English
presents students with opportunities in:
• Reading literary and cultural texts carefully
and critically to demonstrate an understanding of
equity, oppression, and diversity across time and
contexts.
• Producing a variety of creative and critical texts
using appropriate technologies that contribute to
literary and cultural discourses.
• Developing abilities in critical reading, writing,
and thinking necessary to communicate successfully
with other audiences both within and outside the
University.
• Exploring the record of the human experience in
language and valuing social and cultural differences.

Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is an
interdisciplinary degree program offering courses
in which students work together to explore the
ways that race, ethnicity, sexuality, social class,
nationality, age, and ability intersect to shape
gendered experience, injustice, and social change.
Using an intersectional lens, students gain expertise
in analyzing gendered social roles and the ways in
which they affect personal lives, artistic expression,
work, social relationships, institutional structures,
the production of knowledge, and national and
international political and economic relations.
WGSS offers a BA in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality
Studies and minors in Queer Studies and Women’s
Studies. For more information, consult the separate
entry for “Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.”
Preparation for Graduate Study
Students interested in a graduate program
in English at Washington State University
should pursue preparation in English courses
generally approximating one of the first three
undergraduate programs described above. Students
with undergraduate majors in such subjects as
philosophy, foreign languages, and history may also
be accepted for graduate study in the department.
Students preparing for degrees which require a
foreign language reading competency should begin
studying a qualifying language before entering
graduate school. See the “Language Requirements”
page on the Department of English Graduate Studies

Insects and related arthropods are dominant
components in all terrestrial and most freshwater
ecosystems. There are more species of insects
than all the other species of animals and plants
combined. This almost unimaginable diversity
provides the most fertile resource for scientific
inquiry within a number of areas of biology.
Entomology at Washington State University is
active, robust, and dynamic. The curriculum
provides the opportunity to investigate the basic
and applied aspects of the science. Facilities and
training are available for study in major areas
of entomology including, but not limited to,
apiculture, behavior, integrated biological control
and sustainable pest management, integrated pest
management, ecology, insect/plant interactions,
population genetics, physiology, taxonomy/
systematics, biological diversity, environmental
toxicology, and medical/veterinary entomology.
The entomology curriculum provides the
opportunity to study basic and applied aspects of
entomology and prepares students employment
in all aspects and levels of the science. Courses
provide needed training for students in agriculture,
data sciences, education, veterinary medicine,
microbiology, public health, environmental
sciences, and natural sciences.
The department offers courses of study leading
to the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Biology
with an Entomology option; Master of Science
in Entomology, and Doctor of Philosophy
(Entomology). Additional information can be
obtained on the web at http://entomology.wsu.edu.
Preparation for Graduate Study
As preparation for work toward an advanced
degree in entomology, a student should have
completed an undergraduate major in one of the
biological or physical sciences, forestry, agriculture,
or a closely related field. Potential students with
majors in other disciplines are considered on an
individual basis. Background work should include
courses in the biological and physical sciences,
genetics, ecology, entomology, and the plant and
animal sciences.
Graduate Programs
The Department of Entomology offers graduate
programs leading to Doctoral and Master of Science
degrees.
Facilities and training are available for graduate
study in major areas of entomology, including
(but not limited to) apiculture; behavior;
integrated biological control and sustainable
pest management; integrated pest management;
ecology; insect/plant interactions; medical/
veterinary entomology; population genetics;
physiology; systematics; biological diversity and
environmental toxicology. Faculty are housed both
on campus and at Research and Extension Centers
throughout the state. We also maintain strong
cooperative interactions with the USDA ARS lab in
Wapato, Washington.

biogeochemical processes and earth systems
without fully knowing the consequences.
Environmental challenges include food, water, and
energy shortages, changing climate and weather
patterns, rising and acidifying oceans, depleted
soil and forest resources, and endangerment of a
third or more of all the natural biological diversity
of life on Earth. In response, society is shifting
priorities to address these issues and students are
looking for degrees that provide interdisciplinary
training to tackle these emerging problems. Never
before has there been such urgent need to address
complex, multidimensional environmental and
social problems.
The WSU School of the Environment strives to
create synergy by integrating research, teaching,
and extension efforts to ensure an ecologically
sound, socially responsible, and economically viable
future for communities in Washington. The School
integrates the geosciences (the physical context for
global change), ecosystem and natural resource
sciences (the biological context), and social/
sustainability sciences (the human context). School
faculty are located throughout WSU – in Pullman,
Tri-Cities, Vancouver, and the WSU research and
extension centers.
Faculty and students in the School are:
• Generating fundamental knowledge about the
Earth, environmental and ecological processes,
natural resources, and human-environment
interactions.
• Developing solutions to state, national, and
global environmental problems (e.g., sustainable
use of water, forests, wildlife, and other natural
resources).
• Providing cutting-edge interdisciplinary
undergraduate and graduate training to the next
generation of research scientists, environmental and
natural resource managers, environmental leaders,
policy makers, and global citizens.
• Facilitating the integrated research and education
necessary to support the Land Grant mission to
achieve a sustainable future.
• Promoting the long-term conservation and
enhancement of biological diversity and natural
resources in an ecologically sustainable manner.
The WSU School of the Environment has defined
several core themes to better address new and
emerging challenges in the study of earth,
environment, and ecology. These include:
•“Water: Connecting Earth and Life,” current
strengths in eco-hydrology: modeling land and
water interactions, biophysical, chemical and
ecological dynamics in freshwater ecosystems and
water resources in the Columbia River Basin.
•“Global Change: Sustaining Healthy Landscapes
and Communities,” existing strengths in
landscape and spatial ecology, wildlife ecology and
conservation of biodiversity, restoring ecosystems,
and environmental social science.
•“Dynamic Earth,” Earth system science, with
existing strengths in earth system chemistry,
planetary evolution and deep time, and geologic
and environmental hazards.
Specific information below describes courses and
majors under the Bachelor of Science in Earth and
Environmental Sciences.

are concerned with the diverse environmental
challenges confronting the future of all life on Earth.
Students learn to communicate and use critical
thinking and creative problem solving to address
pressing issues confronting global ecology and
sustainability on a dynamic and changing Earth.
Students apply scientific methods, quantitative and
symbolic reasoning, and decision-making processes
as individuals or teams to explore complex scientific
and environmental issues and analyze problems in
both the natural and social sciences. We emphasize
realistic experiential education (e.g., hands-on
labs, field trips and camps) to prepare students
for graduate studies or employment in the fields
of natural resources, environmental science or
earth sciences. Graduates achieve expertise in a
professional specialty and develop the technical
skills and a deeper understanding of the science
and environmental management needed to succeed
in a global society increasingly dependent on
developing a sustainable future.

Earth Sciences Major
Earth Science is the study of the Earth, its
composition, processes, structure, origin and
evolution. Virtually every aspect of modern life is
in some way dependent on the science of geology.
The geologic record provides the context for
understanding episodes of past rapid global change.
It is also the geologist’s job to evaluate groundwater
quality and quantity for drinking water supply,
discover new reserves of energy and raw materials,
assess geologic hazards in land-use planning and
unravel the mechanisms of volcanism, earthquakes,
plate tectonics and the origins of life.
In addition to the University Common
Requirements (UCORE), basic science courses
and the School of the Environment common
core, students majoring earth sciences complete a
series of 300-400-level courses designed to provide
training for professional geological work as well as
preparation for postgraduate study.
The School of the Environment has well-
equipped geological laboratory facilities, including
electron microprobe, X-ray diffraction and
fluorescence instruments, a laser ablation cell
and 6 mass spectrometers for the determination
of trace elements, isotope ratios, and organic
compounds. There are active research programs in
volcanology, geochemistry, tectonics, groundwater
and contaminant hydrology, sedimentology,
stratigraphy, and astrobiology.
Earth Sciences majors are expected to graduate
with a complete understanding of earth, including
its constituent materials, environments, and
processes through which these materials form and
interact, and its physical, chemical, and biological
evolution. Students are expected to be capable
of examining and interpreting relations among
geologic materials in the field. Problem solving and
critical thinking will be applied in the classroom,
laboratory, and field, and effective communication
skills will be expected. Students will demonstrate
quantitative understanding of earth materials and
processes.
The Geology Club is open to all students
interested in geology and allied sciences. It provides
additional opportunities for our students to learn
about local and regional geology. Weekend field
and mineral collecting trips take advantage of the
very diverse geology of the inland northwest region,
and provides other out-of-class opportunities for
students to informally interact with each other,
faculty and professionals outside of WSU.
As preparation for work toward an advanced
degree in geology, a student should have completed,
or plan to take without graduate credit, the following
or their equivalents: SOE 102, 207, 210, 315, 320,
340, 350, 356; one year of general physics; one
year of general inorganic chemistry; mathematics
through two semesters of calculus. A minimum GPA
of 3.0 is normally required for admission.
Environmental and Ecosystem Sciences
Major
The Environmental and Ecosystem Sciences
major is offered for students interested in
biological, physical, or socioeconomic aspects of
environmental and natural sciences. This is the
most flexible of our majors, offering exceptional
opportunities for tailoring of courses to match
individual student interests and needs within the
realm of environmental and ecosystem sciences.
Environmental and Ecosystem Sciences is
concerned with natural and managed environments
and their interactions with biological and human
systems. Emphasis is put on the comprehensive
understanding of environmental and ecological
contexts, assessment of beneficial and disruptive
anthropogenic impacts, and methodologies to
analyze and resolve conflict in complex systems.
Students acquire interdisciplinary perspectives
and understanding necessary to prepare them
for a variety of roles in the study, planning and
management of the environment.
All students in Environmental and Ecosystem
Sciences major will receive a well-rounded, general
science background in the physical and life sciences.
They will develop an in-depth, interdisciplinary
expertise in an area of concentration within the
field. In addition to the University Common
Requirements (UCORE), basic science courses and
a common core taken by all students completing a
BS in Earth and Environmental Sciences, students
select a structured set of courses in concert with
their advisor based upon their area(s) of primary
interest. Lists of approved electives are available
from an advisor.
The School of the Environment has well-equipped
laboratory facilities for physical, chemical, and
biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems (streams
and lakes), modeling environmental processes,
and evaluating impacts of human activities. There
are active research programs examining effects of
invasive species, ecosystem restoration, and many
aspects of water resource management.
The Environmental Science Club provides
opportunities for students with common interests
to share ideas and discuss relevant topics concerning
environmental issues. The club contributes to
sustainability programs at WSU and helps promote
environmentally conscious activities on and around
the WSU campus. In addition, it provides out of class
opportunities for students to interact with faculty
and other professionals. These interactions create
opportunities for networking that helps students
find summer and permanent employment as well
as internship opportunities in their chosen field.
Forest Ecology and Management Major
The Forest Ecology and Management major is
designed to provide students the educational basis
for successfully pursuing a professional career
in forestry. Each forestry student, in addition to
completing the university UCORE requirements,
basic science requirements, the School of the
Environment environmental common core
takes a block of forestry classes in such areas as
forest measurements, sampling, remote sensing,
geographic information systems, plant ecology
and silviculture. In addition, students completing
the basic requirements of this degree also have the
option to select a limited number of professional
electives to further focus their basic skill set. For
example, by selecting the correct courses students
may easily complete a minor in geospatial analysis.
Students completing this degree also meet the
qualifications required in U.S. Office of Personnel
Management for forester.
The student chapter of the Society of American
Foresters (Forestry Club) provides out of class
opportunities for students to interact with each
other socially and professionally, with the faculty
and other professionals in the region. Students
regularly work on forestry related projects for
landowners in the area under the supervision of
faculty members, gaining practical field experience
and further insights into the profession. These
experiences are often helpful in obtaining summer
jobs, internships and professional employment
upon graduation.
Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Major
The Wildlife Ecology and Conservation major
provides students with a basic background in the
sciences plus additional courses emphasizing wildlife
ecology and management of wildlife habitats and
populations. Students are prepared to pursue a variety
of careers focusing on wildlife biology and wildlife
management. The core requirements plus approved
wildlife electives may allow majors to meet the US
Office of Personnel Management requirements for
wildlife biologist, wildlife refuge manager, general
biologist, and zoologist. Through judicious use of
electives a student can also meet additional civil
service requirements for fish biologist and range
conservationist. Wildlife students can further
individualize and often enhance their professional
credentials by minoring in another subject such as
criminal justice, geospatial analysis, or forestry.
In addition to the University Common
Requirements (UCORE), basic science courses and
the School of the Environment common core,
students in this major complete a core of wildlife
classes emphasizing wildlife ecology, management,
nutrition, population ecology, and conservation
biology. Opportunities for specialization and pursuit
of individual student interests beyond the wildlife
core are provided through approved electives in the

232
Environment

The School of Food Science (SFS) works closely
with the University of Idaho (UI) to offer courses
of study in the undergraduate major field of food
science. Some traveling to the UI campus will occur
usually starting the junior year. Students complete
a prescribed course of study leading to the Bachelor
of Science in Food Science with an option in general
science emphasizing areas in processing and
engineering, food sensory, food safety, hospitality
and business management, business, science,
enology, or fermentation science. Graduate degrees
are also offered leading to Master of Science in Food
Science and a Doctor of Philosophy in Food Science.
Food Science
Food Science is the scientific discipline that
supports the food and beverage manufacturing
industry. Food Science is a multidisciplinary
science that applies biology, chemistry, engineering,
microbiology, nutrition, physics, and other sciences
to improve the safety and quality of food products;
create healthy food products; and design new, safer,
and more sustainable food preservation methods.
Food scientists strive to improve the quality and
nutrition of foods through traditional and emerging
preservation technologies. Food scientists conduct
research to mitigate chemical and microbial risk
factors in foods and to understand the causes of
food deterioration and spoilage. Food scientists are
employed around the world by large and small food
processing companies, food ingredient suppliers,
food quality assurance and testing labs, federal and
state governmental agencies, and academia. Food
scientists also work with existing and emerging
companies preparing organic, natural, kosher, and
halal food products.
Graduates of the food science program are
well positioned to meet the evolving challenges,
needs, and opportunities of the food industry not
only in the Pacific Northwest, but also nationally
and internationally. Graduates begin careers in
food quality assurance, food safety microbiology,
technical sales, production management, product
extension or development, regulatory affairs, or
research in the food/allied industries or federal/
state regulatory agencies.

Washington State University, 2024
Food Science students learn to convert food
commodities into high quality, safe and nutritious
food products. As part of the BS degree, students
receive training and learn skills relative to the
production, processing, preservation, safety,
evaluation, and distribution of foods. The food
processing industry is continually challenged to
evaluate existing foods for quality, as well as the
development of new foods to better meet consumer
demands and the nutritional needs of the world.
Students who work at the WSU Creamery (https://
creamery.wsu.edu/) can gain practical processing
and leadership skills in the state-of-the-art creamery
where world-renowned Cougar Gold Cheese is
made.
In the first two years of college, students enroll
in science courses and complete most University
Common Requirements (UCORE) classes. In the
junior and senior years, the curriculum emphasizes
courses in food processing and engineering, food
chemistry, food analysis, food microbiology, sensory
evaluation, and other specialized areas such as the
processing and manufacture of cereal and dairy
products, and fermented foods. A student may be
admitted to the Food Science major upon making
their intention known to the department. Contact
the Food Science Advisor to begin the process, food.
science@wsu.edu.
Student Learning Outcomes
Our graduating seniors will:
• Demonstrate a level of comprehension of Food
Science concepts and analyses equivalent to or
greater than that required by the Institute of Food
Technologists Core Competencies Guidelines.
• Critically evaluate and summarize a food science
issue or problem.
• Apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills
to address current challenges in the food industry.
• Communicate effectively in both written and
oral format with an audience possessing varying
degrees of food science knowledge.
See https://sfs.wsu.edu/undergraduate-student-
learning-outcomes/.
Options in Food Science
The General Option emphasizes open electives
so students can take specific classes in their area
of interest or choose a minor to complement their
degree. This option prepares students to work in the
food industry and related industries, government
agencies, and governmental organizations. This
degree is an IFT (Institute of Food Technologists)
Approved Undergraduate Program and provides a
strong science background leading to graduate or
professional degrees in various fields.
Other Opportunities
Students with specific interests can gain
additional education by taking elective courses,
participating in internships with food companies,
and/or conducting a research project with a faculty
member. Summer internships are available to gain
practical hands-on training. Contact your advisor
for more information. Graduate programs are
also available that lead to the degrees of Master of
Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Food Science.
Transfer Students
Students planning to transfer to the School of
Food Science should coordinate their programs of
study with advisors to select courses applicable to
the degree requirements. Many of the University
Common Requirements (UCORE) courses and
introductory biology, chemistry, microbiology, and
physics courses can be completed at community
colleges. We especially recommend students take
the appropriate science and mathematics courses
required in our first two years of study, so students
are on track when transferring to WSU.
Preparation for Graduate Study
Students who identify an interest in graduate work
are encouraged to contact the advisor no later than
the end of the junior year, so a course of study can be
planned which schedules appropriate prerequisites
to graduate courses and an introduction to research
projects. Students from other science majors who
wish to obtain an advanced degree in food science
are encouraged to apply as they may be well
prepared for graduate studies. Students are required
to take certain core courses required of food science
undergraduates in addition to those needed for their
graduate program. For more complete information
on our graduate program, admission requirements,
and program requirements, review the School of
Food Science website http://sfs.wsu.edu/graduate-
program/. Please see faculty profiles at https://
sfs.wsu.edu/personnel/ for research opportunities.
Admission to the graduate program is based on
ability to complete graduate-level work as evidenced
by undergraduate transcripts; the compatibility of
the student’s objectives with faculty expertise and
program objectives; and availability of graduate
faculty to act as major advisor for the applicant.
The School of Food Science requires TOEFL scores,
in addition to admission materials required by the
WSU Graduate School.
The School of Food Science welcomes inquiries
about our program. Potential students can contact
the School via phone (509-335-4763), email (food.
science@wsu.edu), visit Food Science and Human
Nutrition (FSHN) Bldg., Rm 106, or review the

knowledge gaps that constrain progress in improved
global health, acquisition of contemporary and
innovative investigative skills to address these
gaps, and understanding of policy pathways to
direct and enhance implementation of health
solutions. Specialization includes animal and
zoonotic disease epidemiology and pathogenesis,
economic burden of disease and effect on food
security, emerging and endemic disease surveillance
and diagnosis, infectious diseases epidemiology and
pathogenesis, vaccine discovery and development,
implementation strategy and evaluation, and
animal health policy and metrics.
The program offers flexibility for students with
backgrounds in any of the core disciplines to
pursue advanced training in global health, with
independent study and original research in areas
of the student’s own interests. Students conduct
research on the WSU-Pullman campus, including
in the state-of-the-art BSL2 and BSL3 laboratories
in the Allen Center, and in global field sites. The
interdisciplinary nature of the program assures the
student of interaction with scientists representing
a wide range of research interests in global health
and provides the student with a broad range of
specialized facilities which are available in the
cooperating academic units.

The Department of History’s Undergraduate
Degree Program is designed to produce several
outcomes. We expect students who complete the
requirements for an undergraduate major in History
to: 1) express sophisticated and abstract concepts
clearly in writing; 2) be familiar with the nature of
historical argument and methodologies; 3) frame
research topics and do research at an appropriate
undergraduate level; 4) have a mastery of the broad
outlines of historical developments, themes, issues,
and patterns; 5) develop critical thinking skills that
will allow and encourage them to become life-long
learners.
A major in history can be used in government
service, the new specialty of public history teaching,
several areas of business and industry, and many
other fields. It can also be used in preparation for
study of the law, the ministry, archival work, and
librarianship. Double majors or complementary
minors combining history with other fields are
easily arranged.
The department offers courses of study leading to
the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in History, Bachelor of
Arts in Social Studies, Master of Arts in History, and
Doctor of Philosophy. In cooperation with others,
the department participates in the interdisciplinary
Program in American Studies leading to the degree
of Doctor of Philosophy.

The mission of the Honors College is to offer
students of high ability and initiative an enriched,
four-year core curriculum that satisfies university
graduation requirements and promotes global
competencies. The Honors College helps students
develop genuine intellectual curiosity and a life-
long love of learning through a series of courses
and independent work. Honors students acquire
the broad foundations of liberal learning in the
natural and social sciences, the arts and humanities,
and cultures of the world. In addition, the Honors
College requires competency in foreign language
and encourages education abroad as premier
vehicles for acquiring key competencies for an
increasingly globalized society and economy.
Student Learning Outcomes
Honors College undergraduates understand the
importance of becoming citizens of the world.
They engage in multiple leadership opportunities,
pursue research projects that result in a thesis
or creative project, and often participate in an
international educational experience. Their Honors
curriculum emphasizes skills that help them achieve
excellence, both within their major as well as their
Honors coursework. As stated on our website,
https://honors.wsu.edu/learning-goals-outcomes/
students in the Honors College commit to the
following learning outcomes as they pursue higher
education at WSU: critical and creative thinking,
communication, information literacy, scientific
literacy, quantitative and symbolic reasoning,
cultural competency, and integration of knowledge.
Specifically, as a general education program, the
Honors College expects that its graduates will be
able to: (1) construct a reasoned and evidence-
based position on an issue that takes into account
their own and others’ views; (2) use the library
catalog, databases, and the Internet to find relevant
information while critically evaluating the quality
of those information resources; (3) demonstrate
respect for different cultural systems and traditions
and their contributions to society; (4) choose
the appropriate methodology and theoretical
framework to solve a problem or answer a question
in their discipline; (5) write and speak effectively

256
Honors
Washington State University, 2024
in different contexts for a variety of audiences;
(6) learn to apply quantitative tools and draw
conclusions; and (7) demonstrate competency in
a foreign language.
Courses offered through the Honors College are
open only to students enrolled in the program. For
admissions, see the Honors College section of the
catalog.
Honors College Requirements
A bachelor’s degree earned through the Honors
College requires approximately the same number of
total semester hours as required by the University
Common Requirements (UCORE). Students who
complete the Honors College requirements are
not required to complete the University Common
Requirements for graduation. Students who
transfer from Honors without completing the
Honors College requirements will be responsible
for fulfilling the UCORE.
Honors College students are required to complete
the courses specified in the schedule of studies.
The mathematics requirement for students in the
Honors College can be met in a number of ways (see
footnote 1). In addition, students complete a three-
credit Honors Thesis in the junior or senior year.
A few majors will fulfill this requirement through
design projects in their field. Each student must
choose a thesis advisor, complete a significant piece
of writing, and make a public presentation. Students
who present an outstanding thesis may receive a
“Pass with Distinction” on their final transcript.
The Honors Certificate of Global Competencies
requires a thesis with an international topic as
well as participation in a study abroad experience
and completion of at least six credits while abroad.
Students can also demonstrate competency by
completing a foreign language through the 204
level. The MESI Certificate in Mindfulness-based
Emotional and Social Intelligence requires a
combination of coursework, mindfulness training,
and co-curricular service learning. The HABILE
certificate for students in the Honors and Business
Innovation and Leadership Experience requires core
courses plus pre-approved electives, along with the
co-curricular business requirements associated with
the Carson Career Amplifier Program.
The Honors College requires its students to
demonstrate competency in a foreign language.
With sufficient high school preparation, students
can elect to take an online examination upon
entrance to the Honors College. If additional
preparation in a foreign language is necessary,
students will work with an Honors advisor to
develop an appropriate course of study.
For continued enrollment in the Honors College,
students must maintain a minimum 3.2 cumulative
GPA. Any graded courses used to fulfill Honors
College graduation requirements must receive a
grade of C or better. Successful completion of the
Honors College requires that students fulfill the
Honors Curriculum and have a cumulative GPA of
3.2 or better.

The Landscape, Nursery, and Greenhouse
Management major is a horticulture-based program
that prepares students for opportunities in plant
propagation, the production and marketing of
potted crops, bedding plants, trees, shrubs, and
cut flowers, and in landscape plant management.
This is an exciting major for students interested
in owning or managing a nursery or greenhouse,
attending graduate school in horticulture, working
for university extension offices and research
greenhouses, maintaining landscapes and parks, or
working as wholesale horticultural-product brokers.
Undergraduate Transfer Students
Students planning to transfer to Washington
State University should take courses which meet
the University Common Requirements (UCORE),
and that meet the core requirements for Integrated
Plant Sciences and Agricultural and Food Systems.
Students are strongly encouraged to consult with
an advisor within the Department of Horticulture
for further guidance.
Preparation for Graduate Study
Preparation for graduate study requires the
selection of courses that will benefit later work

Human Development
Washington State University, 2024
Undergraduate Program
In the Department of Human Development,
students focus on how children, youth, adults,
and families develop, change, and face challenges
throughout the lifespan. The Department of Human
Development is a multidisciplinary department
devoted to understanding the nature of human
development within the context of families,
schools, and communities. Students completing
a Human Development degree are well prepared
for a wide range of careers working with children,
adolescents, adults, and/or families in a variety of
professional settings; many Human Development
graduates are also well equipped to enter graduate
school in several disciplines.
Human Development majors may choose to
focus their studies in one of seven options: Family
and Consumer Sciences Education, Lifespan
Development, Early Childhood Education, Child/
Youth Development, Gerontology, Family Services
or Prevention Science. All options lead to a Bachelor
of Arts in Human Development.
The Family & Consumer Sciences Education option
is for students interested in teaching in a junior or
senior high school setting. Family and consumer
sciences teachers instruct courses in foods and
nutrition, family health, human development,
apparel and textiles, family resource management,
family communication, and interior design.
Graduates are prepared for Family and Consumer
Sciences and Career and Technical Education state
certification. They are also well prepared for careers
with agencies and organization that serve the needs
of families in the community.
The Lifespan Development option is for students
who desire to deepen their understanding of the
foundations of development from childhood,
adolescence, to adulthood. Students in this option
will gain psychosocial and bioecological perspectives
on the interrelationships between individuals,
families, organizations, and communities. A lifespan
development focus opens the doors for many
helping professions. Students are ready for careers
in public and private human service agencies, and
local, state and federal government.
The Early Childhood Education option focuses on
children birth-age five. Students gain a deeper
understanding of the importance of building
relationships with children, observing and
documenting their development and learning,
planning and implementing age-appropriate
curricula and assessing the success of the planned
curricula. This option prepares students to be
early childhood educators as they complete a 270-
hour practicum in a high-quality, early childhood
classroom. While this option focuses on preparing
for a teaching role, students are also ready for careers
outside of the classroom working with young
children and their families.
The Child/Youth Development option is designed for
students preparing for careers or graduate education
focused primarily on children and adolescents.
Examples include careers developing programming
for youth (e.g., parks and recreation, after-school
programs, youth development programs); working
with youth engaged in systems of care, including
those who have experienced trauma (e.g. residential
treatment facilities, foster care systems, behavioral
health or developmental services); working in the
juvenile justice system; counseling youth and
families.
The Gerontology option is for students who desire
to deepen their understanding of the foundations of
development across the entire lifespan, particularly
in adulthood to later life. Students in this option
will gain an overview of the interdisciplinary
field of gerontology and explore psychosocial and
bioecological perspectives on adult development
and aging over the life course as it affects individuals,
families, and communities and has social, political,
and economic implications world-wide. Examples
of careers in gerontology include working directly
with older adults in a variety of settings and
administering programs for older adults.
The Human Services option is for students who seek
to improve the quality of life for individuals, families
and communities through direct service, advocacy
or policy. Students will gain an understanding
of: the foundations of human development
including conditions which support or limit
optimal functioning, family functioning and
family dynamics and how those relate to human
development across the lifespan, service delivery
systems, and strategies for working with diverse
clientele. Students in this option may be interested
in careers such as family social service programs,
advocacy and nonprofit work, community
education, and counseling support. This option
will also prepare students for advanced education
in social work, counseling, and family law.
The Prevention Science option is designed
for students who are interested in taking a
developmental approach to improving public
health. Specifically, the Prevention Science option
focuses on (a) identifying risk and protective factors
that shape human development throughout the
lifespan, and (b) designing, implementing, and
evaluating interventions, programs, and policies
that promote well-being for individuals, families,
and communities. The option in Prevention Science
is a good fit for students interested in graduate
studies in fields such as Prevention Science, Public
Health, and Community Psychology; in addition,
this option will prepare students for careers in fields
such as community coalition coordinator, public
health prevention coordinator, and residential
youth counselor.
The department also offers four certificates: early
childhood education, adolescence, gerontology,
and family studies. Students completing a human
development degree may also complete a minor or
approved certificate of study. A minor or certificate
of study should be selected in consultation with a
human development advisor, preferably by the end
of the third semester.
Student Learning Outcomes
We expect our graduating students will
demonstrate: 1) an understanding of social,
emotional, cognitive, and physical development
across the lifespan in the family context; 2) an
understanding of how contextual systems interact
to influence family and individual development; 3)
the ability to critically select, evaluate, and utilize
information to understand and benefit individuals
and families; 4) writing, listening, and speaking
appropriate for human development related
occupations; 5) application of human development
knowledge and skills in professional settings.
Graduate School Preparation
The human development degree provides
preparation for graduate work leading to teaching,
research, counseling, or administrative positions
in domains such as academia, social services, and
counseling.
Graduate Program
T h e d e p a r t m e n t a l s o a d m i n i s t e r s a n
interdisciplinary doctoral program in Prevention
Science. Students in the program learn to conduct
basic research on risk and protective factors, and
to develop, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-
based programs to promote the well-being of
people across the lifespan. The program is offered in
collaboration with the Colleges of Communication,
Education, Medicine, and Nursing, as well as WSU
Extension. Graduates are prepared for careers as
faculty members, program evaluators, research
analysts, and research associates to work in a range
of settings including universities, research institutes,
social service agencies, and consulting firms.

to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical
Sciences Integrative Physiology. This degree is
designed to provide broad training in specific
aspects of physiology and related disciplines to
prepare students for careers in teaching, research,
and service. The curriculum is research intensive
emphasizing the acquisition of theoretical
understanding of a field and or research skills in
preparation for a career in teaching and research.
The Biomedical Sciences Integrative Physiology
degree allows for maximum flexibility within the
curriculum. Students will design their degree plan
in consultation with a faculty mentor, emphasizing
the specialty fields of anatomy, pharmacology or
physiology. It is required that a student contact
and arrange for a faculty mentor prior to admission
to the program.
The objectives for the Ph.D. level training are to
prepare the candidate for a career as an independent
investigator (i.e., can successfully compete for
extramural private and federal funds as the principal
investigator or oversee an industrial research
program).
Applicants are admitted directly into the Ph.D.
from either a master’s degree or bachelor’s degree
from an accredited higher education institution.
To be eligible for admission, candidates must
meet general Washington State University

Individual Interdisciplinary Doctoral
Program
Graduate study leading to the Individual
Interdisciplinary Doctor of Philosophy degree is offered
as an interdepartmental curriculum by graduate
faculty from across WSU. The interdisciplinary nature
of the research must span two distinct disciplines,
typically drawing on faculty expertise from two
different departments. The objectives of the program
are to provide a mechanism for graduate students to
develop and pursue an individually tailored doctoral
degree.
Admission to the IIDP is highly selective. Students
must be extremely motivated and have demonstrated
a strong ability to conduct interdisciplinary research.
Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree and a
master’s degree from an accredited university with a
3.0 GPA for bachelor’s work and 3.0 GPA for master’s
work.
Any faculty member who is recognized as a graduate
faculty in their home department may participate in
training students in the Individual Interdisciplinary
Doctoral Program (IIDP). When admitted, the
student’s home department becomes the IIDP
program.
Before completing an application, the students
must identify members of their dissertation
committee, consisting of a major advisor and at least
four additional faculty members, from at least three
academic units. This dissertation committee oversees
the development of the student’s doctoral project and
helps the student to produce high quality doctoral
research, with rigorous interdisciplinary methodology
and approach.
1. Write a statement of purpose of no more than three
pages that covers: a. Identification and justification
for the two (or more) essential academic disciplines
of interest from which the primary coursework will
be drawn; b. The proposed interdisciplinary research
topic that clearly demonstrates the synergy between
the academic disciplines and how they are each
needed to answer the research question(s)
2. Written commitment from at least two faculty
members (at least one from each academic discipline
of interest) to serve on the doctoral advisory
committee, one of whom will serve as the chair. This
commitment will also confirm that the student’s
research question(s) would be best addressed outside
of a single discipline (i.e., using an interdisciplinary
approach). The requisite additional committee
members can be added after the student has initiated
the program.
The program offers flexibility for students with
diverse backgrounds and prepares students to
be effective researchers, engaging teachers, and
innovative thinkers, under the mentorship of leading
teachers and researchers in various fields. Students will
develop knowledge and understanding of appropriate
concepts, methods, and materials of the two or
more disciplines in their research while creatively
integrating this knowledge into their interdisciplinary
scholarship.
Policies and procedures of the Graduate School
apply to all admissions. Interested students may direct
their inquiries to the IIDP academic coordinator at
iidp.graduate.school@wsu.edu.

The School of Languages, Cultures, and Race
(SLCR) cultivates deeper understandings of
linguistic, cultural, national, citizenship, and racial
perspectives in a global context as explored through
an interdisciplinary approach grounded on the
humanities and social sciences. Located in historic
Thompson Hall, the School stands as a bridge
between the past and the future through its degrees:
American studies and culture, comparative ethnic
studies, foreign languages and cultures, humanities,
and social sciences. Foreign languages have been
offered at WSU since 1890 and Thompson remains
the site for one of the first dedicated language
learning centers in the nation (established in
1911). The interdisciplinary degrees in Humanities
and Social Sciences date back to 1911. At the same
time, the School includes the contemporary and
transdisciplinary envisioning of culture and race
studies that American Studies and Culture, and
Comparative Ethnic studies embody. Together,
these programs collaborate in finding innovative
responses to the challenges of our ever-changing
societies.
The School fosters critical literacy, intercultural
engagement, and the pursuit of global social
justice through grounded, holistic engagement in
interdisciplinary inquiry and programs. Language
studies in context, the study of transnational
cultural and race matters, and integrative approaches
to linguistic, social, and cultural phenomena
provide students with the skills, experiences, and
perspectives necessary to thrive in an increasingly
diverse and heterogeneous global society. The
school interests are centered on the following:
• Critical analysis of culture and its products
around the globe.
• The effects of popular culture and media on
social articulations of race and ethnicity.
• Social and cultural production of languages.
• Social and cultural influence of languages.
• Intersectional and interdisciplinary scholarship
in the humanities and the social sciences.
• Innovative approaches in teaching and scholarly
production.
Above all, the school encourages its constituencies
to make a difference by learning about and
demonstrating a commitment to issues in our
changing world through undergraduate and
graduate education, scholarship, and outreach.
The School offers Bachelor of Arts degree programs
in Comparative Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages
and Cultures (Chinese Language and Culture,
French, Japanese, and Spanish), Humanities
(including an International Studies track with major
concentration areas in Latin American Area Studies,
Germanic Area Studies, French and Francophone
Area Studies, and European Area Studies; and other
tracks in Linguistics), and Social Sciences (with an
option in Personnel Psychology/ Human Resources,
available at WSU-Vancouver only.) The Humanities
and Social Sciences degrees are not identified with
a specific subject-matter field on the diploma.
Additional or second majors in Language for
the Professions are available in French, German,
Japanese, and Spanish.
The School offers undergraduate minors in
language (Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and
Spanish) and cultural minors in American Indian
Studies, Film Studies, French Area Studies, German
Area Studies, Global Studies, Latin American Area
Studies, Popular Culture, and Russian Area Studies.
Language certificates in Arabic, Italian, Korean,
and ‘Core Competencies in Spanish Language and
Culture’ are available as well.
The School offers a Doctor of Philosophy program
in American Studies and Culture.
Facilities
The School is supported by the Language
Learning Resource Center (LLRC) located in the
historic Thompson Hall since 1911. It provides
individual foreign language students with access to
12 Windows 7 PC’s, as well as two HD TVs with VCR
& Blu-Ray DVD players, a dedicated computer with
a high-speed duplex scanner plus a flat-bed scanner
and editing software (Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat
Professional, etc.) LLRC also provides foreign
language courses with class access to 18 Windows
7 Enterprise computers. The upper mezzanine
level (balcony) holds 9 Windows 7 computers and
a 55&Prime; HD-TV with a dedicated HD-DVD &
Blu-Ray player. In addition, the lab/classroom in
Thompson 28 (ground floor) holds 15 Windows 7
computers and an HD LCD Projector.
UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES
Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Ethnic
Studies
The Comparative Ethnic Studies program
(CES) within the SLCR brings together leading
scholars committed to teaching and research, who
have created an intellectual community at the
forefront of critical cultural studies in the Pacific
Northwest. Comparative Ethnic Studies embraces
interdisciplinary, comparative, and transnational
approaches to studying race relations and the
intersectionality of race, gender, class, citizenship,
sexuality, and globalization. The course work fosters
an in-depth understanding of the complexities of
formations of race and culture.
The major in comparative ethnic studies prepares
students to work and function in the multiracial
and multicultural world in which we live. Students
majoring in comparative ethnic studies must

282
Languages, Cultures, and Race

sciences or related areas such as administrative
studies or communications are primary components
in the design of this degree. At WSU-Vancouver only
the Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences also offers an
option in Personnel Psychology/ Human Resources.
The degree is not identified with a specific subject-
matter field on the diploma but it will be reflected in
the transcript. Students interested in being admitted
to this major should contact the College of Arts and
Sciences Advising Center at Daggy 201, 509-335-
8731, or the School.

challenges.
Additional Majors in Language for the
Professions
Students who are admitted to a major may seek
an additional major focusing on the professional
application of a specific language. This additional
major does not lead to a degree. These additional
majors - French for the Professions, German for
the Professions, Japanese for the Professions, and
Spanish for the Professions - offer skills-based,
proficiency-oriented learning that prepares
students to communicate in the target language
in professional settings. The unique combination
of applied foreign language instruction and in-
depth study of the culture(s) in which the target
language is spoken trains students to achieve a level
of proficiency in the language that enables them
to identify and analyze cultural traits and concepts
relevant to those countries and communities.
The distinctive focus of this curriculum, i.e. on
both language proficiency and intercultural
proficiency, provides students entering today’s
increasingly global and diverse workplace with the
communication skills necessary to work effectively
within, between, and across different language
communities. This will enhance marketability and
options for employment and allow students to
become effective global leaders and entrepreneurs.
Learning Goals
To support and enhance the University’s stated
goal of promoting global leadership, the School is
in the unique position to provide WSU students
with the communication skills and intercultural
competence that will allow them to become engaged
participants on a global scale in their chosen field.
• Linguistic proficiency: Depending on the target
language, students can demonstrate an Intermediate
Mid-High level of proficiency (as defined in ACTFL
Proficiency Guidelines) in the target language in
speaking, writing, listening and reading.
• Intercultural competence: Students will
demonstrate knowledge and understanding of
other cultures and their norms as they relate to
professional dealings.
Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this program, students will
be able to:
• Recognize and describe the cultural forces
(history, social values, economic practices, and
politics) that shape the professional practices in
the target culture.
• Analyze and critique professional behaviors
and practices (i.e., through the history of specific
companies, case studies, or current events) within
their disciplinary context, including conducting
basic research tasks.
• Examine one’s own behaviors and norms in the
professional world by contrasting and comparing
them with those of the target culture.
• Identify and value diversity as well as the place
of the self as an identity culturally situated in the
global context.

Graduate Program in American Studies
and Culture
The American Studies and Culture M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees at Washington State University offer
interdisciplinary research training that aims to map
structural inequalities and resistance movements
in a U.S. and a global context. Alumni go on to
academic positions in a variety of institutions,
bringing a critical, intersectional lens to the study of
American cultural and social formations. With a core
faculty in the fields of cultural, ethnic, gender, and
citizenship studies, students drawn to the program
have a strong interest in the scholarly study of and
challenge to social inequalities, whether manifested
in popular culture, immigration policies, gender-
racial discrimination, or other contemporary or
historical loci. The Program offers a broad array
of intellectual possibilities for developing critical
interventions in borderlands studies, the study of
colonialism and empire, race and ethnic studies,
gender, indigenous studies, sports studies, digital
culture and media, film and television studies, and
disability studies.

activities of any given society, and how film allows
us to travel to most places in the world and become
familiar with diverse cultures, traditions, and ways
of thinking. The film studies minor also teaches
students how to discern the cinematic and narrative
features that are used in cinematography and how
culture can influence them. The study of film
encourages critical thinking, respect for cultural
diversity, and detailed knowledge of film as a text
of facts and ideas.
The minor’s program of studies is designed by the
student in collaboration with the coordinator and /
or the advisor. A minimum of 18 credits is required

Global and Ethnic Narrative
Traditions
A systematic approach to the study of a variety
of regional myths, and global, ethnic, and racial
narrative traditions in their original context as
well as in more contemporary reinterpretations
through literature and film and other cultural
arenas, with the aim to challenge and resituate
dominant views about race and ethnicity, gender,
social classes, and different political practices. When
we consider how contemporary writers, filmmakers,
poets, playwrights, painters, music composers,
and other cultural producers use the forms and
elements of these storytelling practices we can more
effectively analyze how these narratives have the
power to articulate political ideas as well as social
and cultural transformations. In this manner, the
program develops our students’ critical thinking
and encourages them to re-interpret the place of the
self as an identity culturally situated. Narratives to
be studied address specific topics related to gender
(representations of women, men, homosexuality,
etc.), age (representations of childhood, youth,
the elderly, etc.), history (representations of war,
revolutions, dictatorships, democratization, etc.),
culture and society (gendered roles, race, nature,
religion, social classes, immigration, etc.), to
mention a few.

and cross-cultural perspective. The Global Studies
minor is designed to provide students with an
integrated exposure to globally related scholarship
across the disciplines, and encourages a student
in any major discipline to think in terms of
the globalization that marks the contemporary
world. The program of study is designed to provide
an exciting interdisciplinary global perspective
on the arts, humanities, social sciences, and
sciences. The minor is flexible and complements
majors from across the University, affording
students the opportunity to reach beyond their
majors, or to take courses related to their majors
outside of the context of the United States.

Materials science includes the principles and
practice of designing, synthesizing, characterizing,
preparing, and fabricating useful materials. The
Materials Science and Engineering Program
accepts qualified bachelor’s and master’s graduates
in the sciences and engineering who now wish to
pursue graduate research for a Ph.D. in the area
where the disciplines overlap. Materials science
is an interdisciplinary program and this feature is
emphasized in the research activities.
Requirements for the Materials Science Ph.D.
include a minimum of 72 credit hours of which
at least 21 hours are graded course work. The
common ground for all participants in materials
science is covered by the core of courses (15 credits)
required of all students. The core provides a general
overview to the field as well as advanced courses
in thermodynamics, solid state physics, applied
mathematics, and materials characterization.
All students must attend the materials science
seminar series (at least 6 credits), which provides an
opportunity to find out the current research activities
in the program and associated departments. After
completion of the core of courses, students then
select additional courses (a minimum of 6 credit
hours) in areas that are applicable to their research
program. These courses can come from any area of
physical science, engineering, and mathematics.
All students complete an original research
dissertation (MATSE 800). Minimum 20 credits.
After admission to candidacy for the degree,
students select a research supervisor from the
materials science faculty. A broad spectrum of
contemporary research areas is available.

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics
offers courses of study leading to the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with options
to emphasize in 6 areas (denoted options), a
Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics, a MS in
Mathematics with two options, MS in Statistics, a
Ph.D. in Mathematics with three options, a Ph.D.
in Statistical Science, an Undergraduate Certificate
in Quantitative Biology, a Graduate Certificate in
Teaching and Learning, an Undergraduate Minor in
Mathematics, an Undergraduate Minor in Statistics,
and a Graduate Minor in Statistics. The flexibility
of the degrees allow students to get experience in
diverse areas such as, statistics and data analytics,
math and computer programming, statistics and
economics, math and biology, etc.
Undergraduate training for mathematics majors
is provided at WSU in the following six options:
actuarial science, applied mathematics, secondary
mathematics teaching with certification, secondary
mathematics teaching without certification,
theoretical mathematics, and statistics. The
options prepare students for careers related to
their fields of interest. The mathematics major
also prepares students for graduate study in such
fields as business, economics, management science
and computer science, as well as mathematics
and statistics. Talented undergraduate majors in
mathematics are given individual and small group
instruction outside of class, sometimes resulting
in research publications. A transdisciplinary
undergraduate degree in data analytics - a multi-
disciplinary field of study comprising mathematics,
statistics, computer sciences, and the study of data
itself - is also available. See https://catalog.wsu.edu/
Pullman/Academics/Info/2456 for more details on
this program.
In addition, an undergraduate certificate in
Quantitative Biology is available. Students not
seeking undergraduate degrees in Mathematics or
Statistics may also pursue a Minor in Mathematics
and/or a Minor in Statistics.
We expect that students graduating with a
mathematics degree will be able to: 1) use their
mathematics and statistics skills within the context
of a strong, fundamental general education, 2)
use the fundamentals of the life and physical
sciences, 3) apply a fundamental knowledge and
practical understanding of mathematics and
statistics, 4) continue learning in both traditional
and non-traditional educational settings, and 5)
communicate effectively.
All students who enroll in mathematics courses
are responsible for satisfying the necessary
prerequisite(s). With only a few exceptions,
WSU undergraduate students are required to take
the WSU Math Placement Assessment prior to
enrolling in their first college-level mathematics
course. See http://www.math.wsu.edu/placement/
welcome.php placement for more information.
At the graduate level, diverse research interests
within our department expose students to multiple
disciplines, and students often combine multiple
areas into unique research projects. A PhD student
has four choices: a PhD in Mathematics, PhD in
Mathematics-Applied Mathematics option, a PhD
in Mathematics with an Education Emphasis, or a
PhD in Statistical Science. The first involves doing
mathematical research, the Applied Mathematics
option focuses on applied mathematical research,
the Education Emphasis option involves research on
the teaching and learning of mathematics, and the
Statistics option involves statistical research. At the
masters level the department offers the following
degrees: a MS in Mathematics, MS in Mathematics–
Applied Mathematics Option, MS Mathematics
– Teaching Option, and a MS in Statistics. In
addition, a graduate certificate in Teaching College
Mathematics is available; and for students seeking
a PhD in another field at WSU, a minor in Statistics
is also available.
Preparation for Graduate Study
As preparation for work toward an advanced
degree in mathematics or statistics, a student should
have completed the equivalent of an undergraduate
degree in mathematics, statistics, or a related
field. Opportunities are provided for removing
deficiencies through the taking of appropriate
courses. Students who contemplate undertaking
studies leading to a doctoral degree should contact
the Graduate Coordinator (mathstat.gradinfo@
lists.wsu.edu) for advice and assistance in the
development of their plans.

The School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering
offers programs in Mechanical Engineering
(Pullman, Bremerton, and Everett campuses), and
Materials Science and Engineering (Pullman). Each
program is detailed as follows.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Mechanical engineering is concerned with (a)
the use and economical conversion of energy from
natural sources into other useful energy to provide
power, light, heat, cooling and transportation,
(b) the design and production of machines to
lighten the burden of human work, (c) the creative
planning, development and operation of systems
for using energy, machines and resources, (d)
the processing of materials into products useful
to people, and (e) developing machines and
algorithms for autonomous systems. Employment
opportunities for graduates exist in the areas of
mechanical design, systems design, equipment
development, manufacturing, CAD/CAM,
algorithm development, project engineering,
production management, applied research, and
sales and service.
The program leading to the Bachelor of Science
degree in Mechanical Engineering is accredited by
the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,
http://www.abet.org.
The mission of the mechanical engineering
program is to provide a broad education in
mechanical engineering that prepares our students
for being successful in professional practice and
advanced studies. The educational objectives of the
undergraduate mechanical engineering program are
as follows: (1) Graduates will meet or exceed the
expectations of employers of mechanical engineers;
(2) Qualified graduates will pursue advanced study
if they so desire; and (3) Graduates will pursue
leadership positions in their profession and/or
communities.
The undergraduate curriculum emphasizes
foundation courses at the third year which
are fundamental to all aspects of mechanical
engineering. These courses emphasize both
analysis and design while accompanying
laboratory courses provide opportunities for
hands-on experiences. Computer applications are
interwoven throughout the program. The courses
in the fourth year emphasize the integration of
fundamental engineering principles into various
applications in mechanical engineering. Students
have an opportunity to complete a sequence of
electives in one of three concentrations or follow
a general path taking technical electives of their
choice. The concentrations include Thermo-fluids,
Manufacturing, and Autonomous Systems. By
completing a concentration, students will have
deeper knowledge in a specific area of mechanical
engineering they would like to pursue in their future
careers. The undergraduate program culminates in
a capstone laboratory course.
Graduates are prepared to enter the field as
engineers or to continue into a graduate program.
An engineering internship program is available for
students to gain industrial experience during their
academic careers.

programs leading to the Master of Science in
Engineering and Doctor of Philosophy (Engineering
Science).
MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
The program leading to the Bachelor of Science
degree in Materials Science and Engineering
is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation
Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
The mission of the materials science and
engineering program is to provide excellence
in education, research, and service in the field
of Materials Science and Engineering through
educational programs that graduate students with
strong backgrounds in scientific and engineering
problem-solving methods. Materials science
and engineering is the application of methods
and principles of the pure sciences to study
engineering materials. The undergraduate program
focuses on (a) the relationship of the microscopic
structure, e.g. crystal structure and defects to the
macroscopic properties of materials, e.g. strength;
(b) experimental techniques for characterizing
physical, chemical and structural properties of
materials; (c) Design and selection of appropriate
materials for given engineering applications.
The specific fields of application covered by
research and instruction programs can be expressed
by the nominal designations of metals (metallurgy),
polymers, ceramics, electronic materials,
biomaterials, and composites. Due to the diversity
of useful properties encountered in materials
engineering, attention must be given to application
and peculiarities of these specific types of materials.
Where possible, however, a generalized approach
toward the study of materials, their properties, their
selection, and their utilization is fostered. The broad-
based instructional approach prepares graduates for
careers in a wide range of industrial settings, from
aerospace companies to corporations specializing in
the production of solid state electronics. In addition,
the undergraduate curriculum prepares students for
continued education at the graduate level.
The educational objectives of the undergraduate
materials science and engineering program are
as follows: (1) Graduates will meet or exceed the
expectations of employers of materials engineers;
(2) Qualified graduates will pursue advanced study
if they so desire; and (3) Graduates will pursue
leadership positions in their profession and/or
communities.
The School offers courses of study leading to the
degrees of Bachelor of Science in Materials Science
and Engineering (accredited by the Engineering
Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.
org) and the Master of Science in Materials Science
and Engineering. The school participates in the
interdisciplinary programs leading to the Doctor of
Philosophy (Engineering Science, Materials Science
and Engineering).

Medicine
Washington State University, 2024
James Record, the College of Medicine is driven by
its mission to solve problems in challenging health
care environments across the state of Washington,
all with a vision of Washingtonians living longer,
better. Through a culture based on valuing the
individual, we are resourceful, agile, inventive and
generous in serving the people of the state and
beyond to develop healthier populations through
research, innovation, interprofessional education
and patient-centered care.
The College of Medicine administration is
primarily located on the WSU Spokane campus with
clinical campuses in Everett, Spokane, Tri-Cities,
and Vancouver. The College of Medicine’s graduate
medical education programs, also known as
residency programs, are available in three locations:
internal medicine in Everett, family medicine in
Pullman, and pediatrics in Spokane. Employing
a community-based model in which medical
students gain clinical experiences in hospital and
health care settings within approximately 100 miles
of the four clinical campus locations, the college
emphasizes training in the kind of environments
where students will ultimately settle to practice
as physicians. All campuses foster active learning
environments, interdisciplinary teaching, research,
outreach, and clinical services.
The college consists of the departments of
Community and Behavioral Health, Medical
Education and Clinical Sciences, Nutrition and
Exercise Physiology, Speech and Hearing Sciences,
and Translational Medicine and Physiology.
The Department of Translational Medicine and
Physiology is the central hub of foundational and
translational biomedical research at the College
of Medicine. The faculty represent a diverse set of
interests, ranging from the neuroscience of sleep to
cancer. Their work encompasses both foundational
and translational research, extending from cell and
molecular physiology to behavioral studies; and
they employ a full range of model systems as well as
human subjects. The department provides research
opportunities to graduate students in participating
Ph.D. programs and to medical students.
The Department of Community and Behavioral
Health extends the reach of the college’s mission by
improving health outcomes through community-
informed research and the development of
evidence-based policies and practices. The
department provides the opportunity for the
college’s research enterprise to hone its focus in
these areas and bring behavioral health to the fore.
The Department of Medical Education and
Clinical Sciences delivers the MD program, training
medical students to be insightful and compassionate
physicians. It immerses students in a variety of
real-world and simulated learning environments
that provide them with the clinical and behavioral
competencies to be successful in the future practice
of medicine. In addition to preparing students to
care for individual patients, it readies them to take
the lead in addressing community health care issues.
Students learn to recognize problems in health care
delivery, innovate solutions, and mobilize change
that improves the health of entire populations.
The department also delivers the Master of
Healthcare Administration and Leadership and two
professional certificate programs, the Certificate in
Leadership and the Certificate in Medical Ethics.
These programs provide training to current and
future health care leaders in key leadership skills
and professional competencies.
The Department of Nutrition and Exercise
Physiology focuses on the effects of nutrition
and physical activity on human health. The
interdisciplinary program combines study in human
nutrition, exercise physiology, and biological
sciences, along with population, social and
psychological sciences. Opportunities for research
and applied, practical experiences are the core of
the instructional methods for both undergraduate
and graduate students. The academic programs offer
degrees at the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. levels.
The Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences
offers programs leading to a B.A. in Speech
and Hearing Sciences and a M.S. in Speech and
Hearing Sciences in speech-language pathology.
Training in speech and hearing sciences through
the bachelor’s degree prepares students for a range
of careers in health professions, education and
social services, among others. State and national
clinical and educational licensure and certification
require completion of the master’s degree.
Graduate students are prepared as speech-language
pathologists to provide direct and consultative
services in medical and educational settings. The
faculty’s research contributes to the evidence base
of the profession, ensuring that future generations
of professionals are prepared to provide the best
possible health care. The program offers degrees at
the B.A. and M.S. levels.

MED ETH 510 Seminar in Conceptual Foundations
of Bioethics. These courses take students through
basic tools of moral reasoning, including basic
concepts in logic (fallacies, validity and soundness,
etc.); descriptive and normative reasoning,
positive and negative rights, basic approaches
to morality (deontology and consequentialism,

ETH 530 The Practice of Clinical Ethics and MED
ETH 540 Seminar in Clinical Ethics: Methods,
Process, Skills & Traits. These courses delve into
the practical aspects of case analysis and the practice
of ethics consultation in the clinical setting, with
particular focus on the traditional range of topics
in this emerging field of study (informed consent;
surrogate decision making; professional rights of
conscience; concepts of welfare and quality of life,
etc.). During the seminar portion of this concurrent
set of courses, students are taught the basic tools of
chart writing, information gathering, and conflict
resolution techniques essential to the conduct of
ethics case consultation in a clinical setting.

The Department of Military Science is the formal
designation of the Army ROTC program at
Washington State University. It is designed to
educate, train, and motivate qualified students to
serve as commissioned officers in the U.S. Army
upon graduation. The military science department
offers academic, professional, and technical
education and training that complements the
educational programs and goals at WSU.
The military science curriculum comprises a
two-year basic course (first and sophomore years)
and a two-year advanced course (junior and senior
years). The basic course is open to all WSU students.
Enrollment in the advanced course is offered only
with the approval of the department chair and upon
completion of basic courses.
At WSU, military science courses emphasize
training in a practical environment. Students learn
leadership skills through classroom instruction,
on-campus leadership labs, and summer training
opportunities. The goal of this training is to develop
leadership skills applicable in both military and
civilian occupations. During the summer, usually
between the junior and senior year of academic
study, cadets must attend Advanced Camp at Fort
Knox, KY. This is a 43-day leadership practicum
administered by Officers and NCOs of the U.S.
Army that develops and assesses the leadership
capabilities of the cadets.
Competitive, merit-based scholarships are
available to deserving individuals. These
scholarships pay either Tuition and associated
fees, or Room and Board. Scholarship winners
also receive $1200/year for books ($600 each
semester). Contracted cadets receive a monthly
stipend of $420 per month. High school juniors
may apply for a four-year Army ROTC scholarship
beginning June 12th after their junior year, with a
deadline of January 10th of their senior year of high
school. Students at WSU may apply for campus-
based scholarships if they meet GPA, medical and
physical requirements.
High school students may also join ROTC by
enlisting into the Army National Guard or Army
Reserves and simultaneously serving as a cadet in

Military Science
Washington State University, 2024
the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP) while
enjoying all of the financial benefits that accompany
the program. Additionally, special scholarships are
available for SMP Cadets who pursue a commission
into the Army Reserves through Guaranteed Reserve
Forces Duty (GRFD) scholarship. Prospective cadets
interested in the SMP Program should also inquire
about the tremendous benefits of yet another type
of scholarship called the Minuteman Scholarship.
Upon successful completion of the advanced
course and graduation from WSU, cadets are
commissioned as U.S. Army officers and serve in
the Active Duty Army, the Army Reserves, or the
Army National Guard. For more information, please
contact Mr. Timothy A. Tate at (509)-308-9676 or

biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology
to answer questions in a wide range of research areas
including protein biochemistry, molecular biology
of gene regulation, enzymatic reaction mechanisms,
signal transduction, DNA repair, reproductive
biology, DNA-protein interactions, plant and
natural product biochemistry, and structural
biology including nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography.
The program offers two curricular options leading
to the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry. The
biochemistry/biophysics option provides increased
emphasis on chemistry, physics, mathematics,
and physical biochemistry, and yields a minor in
chemistry. The biochemistry/molecular biology
option provides increased emphasis on molecular
and cell biology.
GENETICS AND CELL BIOLOGY
Genetics and cell biology are interrelated sciences
that are fundamental to all fields of modern
biology. Undergraduates who major in genetics
and cell biology will be well versed in aspects of
the rapidly emerging fields of genomics, epigenetics,
proteomics, bioinformatics and molecular signaling.
The program affords students the opportunity to
learn from and interact with scientists whose diverse
research programs include the genetics of cancer
and development, chromosome abnormalities,
DNA repair mechanisms, stem cell biology and the
biology of reproduction. Our faculty work with
a diverse group of model organisms including C.
elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice and rats, as
well as using cell culture, plants, and microbial
experimental systems. Graduates of the degree
will be prepared to work in careers that traditionally
may not have required science training including:
science communication, forensics, law enforcement,
community outreach science organizations and
science policy development. In addition, students
will be trained for positions as researchers in

by graduate faculty from the Departments of
Crop and Soil Science, Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science, Horticulture and Landscape
Architecture, Molecular Biosciences, Plant
Pathology, Biological Sciences, and the Institute
of Biological Chemistry. The objectives of the
program are to provide the graduate student with
a broad knowledge in molecular plant sciences
and with research experience in a chosen area
within this discipline. Specialization includes
cellular and subcellular physiology, the molecular
biology and biochemistry of plant-related processes,
photosynthesis and photorespiration, nitrogen
fixation, phytochemistry, the physiology of vascular
plants, metabolism, plant pathogen interactions,
hormonal interactions and regulation of growth,
crop production physiology, and physiological
ecology as well as related areas in agriculture and
biology.
Students entering the program must have
completed their baccalaureate degree with training
in one year each of elementary biology or botany,
and physics, chemistry through one semester of
organic chemistry and biochemistry, one semester
each of molecular plant sciences and genetics,
and mathematics (through calculus). Limited
undergraduate deficiencies may be remedied by
taking the appropriate courses upon enrollment
in the graduate program on a provisional basis.
Degree requirements include courses in molecular
biology, advanced molecular plant sciences, plant
morphology and anatomy, and metabolism. To
meet the minimum requirements of core course
credit in the Graduate School, elective courses are
chosen as approved by the student’s advisor and the
supervising committee of graduate faculty. There is
no foreign language requirement.
Policies and procedures of the Graduate School
apply to all admissions. Interested students may
direct their inquiries to molecular plant sciences
or to any participating faculty member. Should the
latter route be followed, preference for the Program

While preparing its students to be successful,
innovative, and employable musicians in a 21st-
century career field, the School of Music also strives
to make its expertise available to anyone who seeks
to benefit from it, regardless of where they live,
where they come from, what they believe, or what
their life experiences have been.
All efforts are directed toward the betterment of
human existence through the uncovering of new
information, the discovery of how to use that
information to solve problems, and the creative
expression of human experience. We serve diverse
communities across the wide reach of the WSU
institution, through a musical practice that is
fundamental to emotional wellness, constructive
dialogue, and self-reflection.
The School of Music at Washington State
University participates in and fully supports efforts
to ensure equal opportunity in and access to its
programs. Copies of legislation and policies relating
to affirmative action, equal opportunity, non-
discrimination, non-harassment, ADA, and other
issues are available at the WSU Center of Human
Rights. Some of these materials are retained in the
School’s Office.
The School of Music regards each class attended,
each event sponsored, each meeting held, each
position vacancy offered, as an opportunity to
promote diversity of ideas and to ensure free
pursuit of life by those who are members of our
community. We hope that each person participating
in the School’s activities honors this commitment
to a humane and supportive atmosphere for our
teaching, learning, research and creative activity,
and service.
Performance Studies in Music
Performance studies are offered on several levels
to meet the needs of music majors as well as those
of students from the general university community.
There are no additional fees or tuition charges for the
use of practice facilities. The 100-level performance
studies are open to any student without audition
through class instruction. The 200-level denotes

339
Music
Washington State University, 2024
group or private instruction for music minors
and other advanced non-music majors by special
permission of the department chair (audition
required).
Individual instruction in performance studies
is offered at the 300- and 400-level for music
majors. All students enrolled in 200-400-level
performance instruction are required to attend
weekly convocation (student recital), attend recitals
as required, participate in at least one approved
music department ensemble, and take applied
jury examinations at the end of each term. A small
tuition charge is assessed per 200-400-level course,
not dependent on total credits.
Performance studies may not be taken on a pass-
fail basis.
Bachelor of Arts
This program offers a broad musical understanding
within a liberal arts background. We expect our
graduating students be able to: 1) demonstrate
mastery of music theory (an understanding
of organizational patterns of music and their
interaction, and of musical forms and structures
and the ability to employ this understanding in
aural, verbal, and visual analyses); 2) competently
perform on an instrument of choice (including
voice) and effectively communicate on the literature
for that instrument and for appropriate ensembles,
and demonstrate a basic performance proficiency
on the piano; 3) critically evaluate the history and
development of music through the present time
and place music in historical, cultural and stylistic
contexts; 4) comprehend the basics of non-Western
music and/or jazz, and demonstrate a rudimentary
capacity to create derivative or original music both
extemporaneously and in written form; and 5) work
independently on a variety of musical problems
by combining their capabilities in performance,
analysis, composition and improvisation, and
history and repertory. Students often elect a minor
in another field.
Pre-Health Professions Program
The Bachelor of Arts/Pre-Health Professions
program is a four-year program designed to meet the
needs of students wishing to major in music while
completing the required prerequisites required for
admission into a profession pre-health program.
Students should work with a Health Professions
Student Center advisor to make sure they fulfill all
the pre-requisite requirements for admission into
a professional program, including taking correct
prerequisite courses, preparing for exams, and
creating a resume that is competitive for admission
into the student’s desired program. The exact
order in which students take their required music
courses will depend on their scores on diagnostic
exams. If students need to take math and science
remedial courses, students will complete the
music academic portion of this degree as written.
If students are prepared to immediately start their
math and science pre-requisite courses, students
will typically take their music theory and music
history a year later than written in the degree plan.
Each student’s specific program of study will be
constructed through a collaboration between the
music and the HPSC advisors before the start of the
first semester.
Bachelor of Music
This program offers majors for specialization in
performance, composition, music business, and
music education. The curriculum is designed
to prepare students as professional musicians,
teachers, and practitioners of music. We expect
our graduating students be able to: 1) demonstrate
mastery of music theory (an understanding
of organizational patterns of music and their
interaction, and of musical forms and structures
and the ability to employ this understanding in
aural, verbal, and visual analyses); 2) competently
perform on an instrument of choice (including
voice) and effectively communicate on the literature
for that instrument and for appropriate ensembles,
and demonstrate a basic performance proficiency
on the piano; 3) critically evaluate the history and
development of music through the present time
and place music in historical, cultural and stylistic
contexts; 4) comprehend the basics of non-Western
music and/or jazz, and demonstrate a rudimentary
capacity to create derivative or original music both
extemporaneously and in written form; and 5) work
independently on a variety of musical problems
by combining their capabilities in performance,
analysis, composition and improvisation, and
history and repertory.
Music Performance and Composition
These majors offer professional preparation
in music with specialization in performance
or composition. The curriculum is designed to
prepare students to become professional performers
in their respective major instrument or voice, or
professional composers. Students following options
in performance or composition are required to
present an acceptable senior recital in the major
performance medium, or compositions for
composition majors. Students following options
in performance are also required to present an
acceptable junior recital in the major performance
medium. Students pursuing Performance in Jazz
Studies are limited to specific major performance
instruments as stated in the degree description.
Music Business
This major offers professional preparation in
music with specialization in the music industry.
The curriculum is designed to prepare students
in entrepreneurship, arts management, fine arts
marketing and promotion, recording studio
management, music publishing and copyright,
venue management, and retail operations. Students
pursuing a Music Business degree are expected to
pass a piano proficiency exam, achieve a cumulative
2.5 GPA and a grade of C or better in all music
classes, and perform a successful half senior recital.
Music Education
This program offers professional preparation
in music with specialization in music education.
The curriculum is designed to prepare students as
professional teachers of music. Students following
any of the music education or elective studies
options are required to present an acceptable senior
half recital in the major performance medium.
Students following any of the music education
options must have a minimum GPA of 2.5 in all of
the following areas: cumulative GPA, Professional
Education Core with a C or better in each course,
and academic major (and minor if any) with a C or
better in each course. Students admitted as majors
in any of the music education options must also
be admitted as majors in the College of Education.
Bachelor of Music in Music Education,
option without endorsement
This degree provides valuable, current, and
marketable options for students seeking pre-
professional training in music, and in music
education. Students in this option may opt to
apply for the MA program of study in music at WSU
where they may elect to complete courses required
for a teaching endorsement and state certification.
Admission to graduate school and the School of
Music graduate program following completion
of this degree is determined by application on an
individual basis.
Master of Arts in Music
Please consult the current WSU Graduate Study
Bulletin. For students pursuing the combined BM/
MA with teacher certification in Music, please
consult the department.
Schedule of Studies
Normal progress in all music degree curricula
requires enrollment during the first year in 300-level
performance studies. Such enrollment requires
an audition which is best completed during the
semester (usually spring) prior to the student’s
matriculating in the university. Students who do
not audition early must do so during the first week
of classes in the term. All first-year students will be
enrolled in MUS 251 and 252. Students who have
earned a 4 or 5 on the AP music theory exam are
exempted from MUS 251. Students who have taken
AP music theory but did not take the exam or earned
a 3 or lower on the exam will have the option to
attempt to test out of MUS 251. Transfer credit
from another college or university may be accepted
pending a review of the student’s grades, transcript,
and syllabus. For more information, please contact
the music academic advisors.

Student Learning outcomes
• Critical, Creative and Musical Reasoning: This
includes learning to analyze and interpret music, to
express the composer’s intention, the character of
the music and to convey the emotion of the work.
• Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning: This
involves taking the abstract symbols on the page
and making musical sense of them, interpreting
the rhythmic and pitch elements of the music and
making expressive choices based on the notation
on the page.
• Information Literacy: Musicians must understand
the historical and cultural aspects of the music they
are performing to present a musically and artistically
convincing performance. Additionally, students
must become familiar with a wide range of important
works from the traditional western musical canon
as well as a broad range of musical styles and genres
from diverse cultures across the globe.
• Communication: Music students in the 21st
century must be able to effectively write about,
speak about, analyze, listen to, and perform music
for themselves and others.
• Diversity: Students perform, study, interpret,
listen to, and analyze music written by composers
representing diverse backgrounds, cultures, social
identities, and traditions while valuing the different
perspective’s impact on the global society in which
they live.
• Integration of Learning: All music degrees and
professions in the 21st century require individuals
to integrate the previous learning outcomes to
successfully perform, teach, and share music.

2nd Floor, Hays Hall; University of Idaho
208-885-6333
The Navy-Marine Corps Officer Education Program,
administered and taught by the NROTC staff at the
University of Idaho, is open to qualified persons and
offers scholarships leading to commissions in the
United States Navy and Marine Corps. Normally,
students enter the program at the beginning of their
first year. However, selected students may enter up
to the end of the sophomore year. During the four
years, students take up to 24 credits of professional
courses taught by the NROTC staff officers. In
addition to professional courses, NROTC students
must participate in close order drill and physical
training each semester. Following graduation and
commissioning, new officers are offered a broad
variety of duty assignments including duty on
surface ships, nuclear submarines, information
warfare, naval aviation, and special operations units
in the Navy; law, ground or aviation assignments in
the Marine Corps.
College Program
Application for this non-scholarship program is
made through the Department of Naval Science.
Students receive their uniforms and naval science
textbooks at no cost. At the end of their sophomore
year, students are eligible to be selected for Advanced
Standing and will begin receiving a monthly stipend
of $350 per month, which will increase to $400 per
month as seniors. College Program students may
be nominated by the Professor of Naval Science
for a two- or three-year scholarship as first-year or
sophomore students if their academic and military
aptitude marks are sufficient to warrant such
nomination. The program requires one training
cruise during the summer following the junior year
to meet commissioning requirements.
Scholarship Program
Naval Science (Navy or Marine-Option)
Scholarship students’ benefits include tuition, fees,
a $750 book allowance, and a monthly stipend of up
to $400. Application for this program is normally
made during the early fall of the students’ senior
year of high school. Initial selections are based on
college entrance examination scores (SAT or ACT),
high school academic performance, and extra-
curricular activities. Some exceptions exist for
students who cannot take the SAT or ACT.
A student on scholarship participates in at least
three summer training cruises of three to six weeks
duration. During the first summer, students are
introduced to the Surface Warfare, Submarine,
Marine Corps, and Aviation communities. The
second and third summers are spent aboard ships,
within air crews, or at special operations training
facilities and often include travel to foreign ports.
During summer cruises, the students receive Active
Duty E-5 pay, in addition to room and board.
Marine Corps Option
Scholarship and College Program students who
desire a Marine Corps commission may apply for
the Marine Corps option during their first two years
in college. Students taking this option enroll in
specialized classes on Marine Corps subjects during
their junior year and participate in summer training
at Officer Candidate School, Quantico, Virginia
during the summer following their junior year.

Neuroscience is the study of how the nervous
system impacts physiology, behavior, and health. It
seeks to answer questions at the molecular, cellular,
systems, behavioral, cognitive, and societal levels
through application of a wide array of approaches
and techniques. Neuroscience research is critical not
only to improving learning and performance, but
also addresses some of the most vexing problems
that prevent good health. It impacts the very nature
on how we view ourselves as sentient beings. WSU
has a neuroscience faculty engaged in numerous
focuses with particular strengths in the areas of
energy homeostasis, sleep, circadian biology,
addiction, emotions and well-being, sensory
processes, neuronal function, electrophysiology,
and movement. The Program sponsors Bachelor
of Science, Master of Science, and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees, in addition to minors at the
undergraduate level.
The undergraduate program for majors is designed
for students interested in preparing for professional
study in the health sciences (such as Medical
Doctor or Doctor of Veterinary Medicine), graduate
school, or for those who wish to use their training
in laboratory settings in universities, government
organizations, or industry.
Computational neuroscience is an option
within the undergraduate neuroscience major and
links the information processing features of the
nervous system with information processing of
computer systems. Accordingly, the computational
neuroscience track supplements the neuroscience
core curriculum with information technology
courses. In this way students learn not only of the
brain and its information processing mechanisms,
but also of modern computer hardware and
software technologies. Upon completion of the
four-year curriculum, a BS in Neuroscience will be
awarded. Furthermore, the program is designed to
allow students to acquire breadth in computation
subjects or, alternatively, to focus on either software
or hardware aspects of computation. Students
choosing to acquire breadth in computational
subjects will be well prepared for graduate study
in most areas of neural and biomedical science,
including bioengineering. Students choosing a
software or hardware focus may obtain a minor in
either computer science or computer engineering.
Student Learning Outcomes for BS
neuroscience majors
Knowledge:
• Demonstrate knowledge of, and recognize the
relationships between, the structure and function
of molecules and tissues involved in neurobiological
systems at all levels: molecular, cellular, and
organismal.
• Recognize the impact that science has on culture,
and vice versa.
Skills:
• Perform basic laboratory techniques used in
neuroscience research and understand and apply
principles of laboratory safety.
• Locate and retrieve scientific information and
read, understand, and critically evaluate primary
literature.
• Prepare oral and written reports in a standard
scientific format.
• Apply the scientific process, including designing,
conducting, and evaluating experiments and testing
of hypotheses.
• Use mathematics and statistics to evaluate
scientific evidence and interpret graphs and tables.
Attitudes
• Recognize that all areas of science are integrated
and interconnected.
• Appreciate scientific knowledge as something
that is not static, but constantly expanding through
the ongoing work of researchers.
• Value ethical conduct in science.
• Recognize that the best decision-making and
policies are based on evidence.
Transfer Students
Transfer students must satisfy the program
requirements for graduation. Science courses
taken at other institutions will be evaluated and
credits accepted where possible. Transfer students
are strongly encouraged to enroll in math and
chemistry classes at the appropriate level to meet
the program requirements prior to transferring.
Inquiries should be directed to the Associate
Director of Undergraduate Program.
7-Year Honors Neuroscience/Veterinary
Medicine Degree Program
Academically qualified undergraduate students
who meet the highly selective criteria for
admission to WSU’s Veterinary Medical Program
may apply to the 7-year BS/DVM degree program
in neuroscience after completion of one year of
Honors College coursework at WSU. If accepted
into the program, the student will work toward a
Bachelor of Science in neuroscience in the first three
years of the program and work toward the doctor
of veterinary medicine degree in the following four
years. The first three years are a combination of
WSU Honors College courses and regular university
undergraduate courses that fulfill the pre-veterinary
and Neuroscience major requirements. The last
four years are the traditional Doctor of Veterinary
Medicine program, plus completion of an honors
thesis. Prospective applicants must be admitted to
the WSU Honors College and enrolled in Honors
courses. See the Honors College for additional
information.
Preparation for Graduate Study in
Neuroscience
The graduate program prepares students for
careers in academia, industry, and government
service. Students work closely with faculty members
who are internationally known for their research
accomplishments in energy homeostasis, sleep,
circadian biology, addiction, emotions and well-
being, sensory processes, neuronal function,
electrophysiology, and movement. Upon
graduation, students with a doctoral degree are
credible international experts in the area of their
thesis research. They will have developed cutting
edge technical research skills, be capable of
independently organizing and writing publishable
research manuscripts, know the fundamentals on
how to write competitive research proposals, have a
breadth of knowledge that enables them to critically
evaluate neuroscience research, and finally, develop
insights that help them identify areas ripe for future
investigation. These skills are not only appropriate
for basic research, but the ability to organize a set
of sophisticated goals, identify a plan to accomplish
those goals, and then successfully complete the plan
are skills transferable to many jobs. Our graduates
have gone on to excellent positions in tier-one
research universities, teaching colleges, industry
(e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and medical
devices), as well as professional schools (e.g.,
medical, veterinary, optometry).
To be eligible for admission, candidates must meet
general Washington State University requirements
outlined at the Graduate School website: http://
gradschool.wsu.edu/ in effect at the time of
their admission, as well as the current graduate
neuroscience program requirements.
Applicants to the Ph.D. or M.S. program are
required to have a Bachelor’s degree from an
accredited higher education institution. Applicants
must have a minimum grade point average of 3.0
(A=4.0). Applicants will have completed courses
in inorganic and organic chemistry, biochemistry,
calculus, physics and a minimum of three courses
in different areas of the biological sciences. It is
advisable that applicants have a basic statistics
course prior to entering the neuroscience program.
Application documents must include the following:
• College transcripts (unofficial acceptable for
initial review–upon admittance official transcripts
are required)
• Three (3) letters of reference
• Resume or curriculum vitae
• Personal statement describing why you are
interested in studying neuroscience (clearly define
which faculty mentor (minimum of 3) you are
interested in working with and explain why).
If admitted to WSU, you will have the ability to
refine your choice of faculty mentors while doing
lab rotations. Included in the personal statement
describe an achievement that you are proud of and
discuss how you reached your goal, and any obstacles
you had to overcome to reach it. Conversely, tell us
about a time when you didn’t achieve a goal and
what you learned from the experience (maximum
word length is 350 words).

in neuroscience and/or biomedicine over the past
five (5) years and explain why you think it was
important (maximum word length is 350 words
for statement). Be sure to cite references used after
the writing statement. An additional maximum
length of 350 words is given for the cite references.
Turning in a document over the maximum word
length may cause your application to be disqualified
from consideration.
• TOEFL scores (minimum score 100). IELTS
(minimum score 7), or Duolingo (minimum score
115) required for applicants whose native language
is not English. See https://gradschool.wsu.edu/

DOCTOR OF NURSING PRACTICE (DNP)
PROGRAM
The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program
prepares students to be leaders in clinical practice
and allows graduates to engage in advanced nursing
practice. Specialty track options within the DNP
include the Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) route;
the Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner
(PMHNP) route; and the post-Master’s general
(PMG) route. FNP and PHMNP routes may be
done in 3 or 4 year progression plan options, and
the PMG route may be done in a 5 or 8 semester
option. Information and Ssample progression
plans are found on the DNP section of the WSU
Nursing website: https://nursing.wsu.edu/graduate-

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS
The College of Nursing offers two pre-professional
baccalaureate programs. The prelicensure Bachelor
of Science in Nursing (PL-BSN) undergraduate
program is open to students beginning a nursing
career. Students in this program complete
approximately four academic years of full-time
study. The RN-BSN undergraduate program is
open to already-licensed registered nurses (RNs)
who completed an Associate Degree in nursing and
who wish to obtain a bachelor’s degree in nursing.
Students in this program complete approximately
one year of full-time study through a variable
schedule.
The program of study for programs grants a
degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).
Undergraduate nursing programs at WSU are
approved by the Washington State Board of Nursing
and nationally accredited by the Commission on
Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).
PL-BSN Students
Students with no previous preparation in nursing
may complete pre-nursing course work (first and
sophomore years) at Washington State University
(Pullman or Tri-Cities campus locations), Whitworth
University, or another college or university. Pre-
nursing coursework provides the student with a
foundation of core preparatory knowledge in the
sciences and the humanities.
The 300-400-level courses in the nursing major
(junior and senior years) are offered at the College
of Nursing in Spokane, Tri-Cities, and Yakima.
These courses provide professional preparation in
nursing, balancing course work with supervised
clinical practice experiences in hospitals, healthcare
organizations, and community settings. Upon
successful completion of the PL-BSN program,
graduates are eligible to take the National Council
Licensure Examination (NCLEX) to become eligible
for licensure as Registered Nurses.
To apply for admission, applicants must be at
junior standing (60 semester hours/90 quarter
hours), have completed College of Nursing
admission requirements, and completed WSU’s
University Common Requirements (UCORE) or
equivalent course work. The College of Nursing
admission requirements are viewable at https://
nursing.wsu.edu/ug-programs/bsn/. Meeting with
an academic advisor prior to applying is highly
recommended.
RN–BSN Students
Students who are already licensed Registered
Nurses may apply to the RN–BSN program at
any time following the completion of their basic
Registered Nursing education. The RN – BSN is
offered at Spokane, Tri-Cities, and Vancouver WSU
campuses, and at the Yakima teaching site on
the campus of Pacific Northwest University. The
program is flexible, and builds on pre-licensure RN
competencies and is focused on additional pre-
professional nursing competencies that include,
research, leadership, patient care quality and safety,
informatics, and population health.
To apply for admission, applicants must be at
junior standing (60 semester hours/90 quarter
hours), have completed College of Nursing
admission requirements, and completed WSU’s
University Common Requirements (UCORE) or
equivalent course work. Applicants must also meet
the requirement of a current, unencumbered WA
state RN license or eligibility for licensure. The
College of Nursing admission requirements are
viewable at https://nursing.wsu.edu/ug-programs/
rn-bsn/. Meeting with an academic advisor prior to
applying is highly recommended.
Transfer Students
All students who plan to transfer to nursing at
Washington State University from other institutions
should discuss their plans early with their academic
advisor so that the pre-transfer program of study will
be appropriate to nursing degree requirements. The
College of Nursing offers pre-enrollment advising at
campus locations in Spokane, Tri-Cities, Vancouver,
and Yakima for Registered Nurses who plan to
obtain the BSN from Washington State University.
Student Learning Outcomes
Program outcomes for our BSN students are:

The College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical
Sciences (CPPS) offers a personalized education for
students wishing to pursue a career in pharmacy.
The doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) curriculum
is a four-year degree. The first three years are
delivered at the WSU Health Sciences campus in
Spokane, Washington or the Pacific Northwest
University of Health Sciences Campus in Yakima,
Washington. During the first three years, student
pharmacists develop a foundation in biomedical
and pharmaceutical sciences, engage in peer-to-
peer role play and simulations of clinical scenarios,
and eventually work with complicated patient
cases and develop confidence in building patient
specific plans.
During the fourth professional year, students
gain experience in a variety of health care settings,
including community, institutional and long-term
care settings. The curriculum consists of 6 six-week
rotations of advanced experiential training, in which
students will be assigned to a variety of geographic
locations in Washington, Oregon, California and
Idaho. Students have the opportunity rank their
preferred geographic locations to complete the
majority of rotations.
The college offers an additional degree option,
the doctor of pharmacy with research honors.
The curriculum for this option includes additional
coursework: a course in responsible conduct
of research, and research credits taken in both
semesters of the second and third professional years.
Interested students may apply for admission to the
research honors program in their first year.
The application period each academic year is from
July to January. Late admissions applications will
be considered until June 1, if there are remaining
positions for students. Students should prepare
and submit their application one calendar year
before they intend to begin the pharmacy program.
Although a bachelor’s degree is not required for
admission, pre-requisites for admission require
three years of pre-pharmacy education. PCAT is not
required for admission.
The college has holistic application review process.
This process considers a range of characteristics
beyond academic metrics such as grades and
test scores. While we will evaluate grades and
prerequisite grade trends, we will also evaluate
students on a case-by-case basis by reviewing letters
of recommendation, personal statements, and our
professional goal statements. After our initial
application review, you may be invited to interview.
We encourage interviewees to be themselves and
share stories throughout the interview to help us
better understand you and your motivations.

Physics is the study of nature at its most fundamental
level. It is the science upon whose principles all
other sciences and technologies are based. A major
in physics is ideal preparation not only for further
study in physics but also for advanced study in
biophysics, medicine, astrophysics, geophysics,
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences

chemical physics, engineering, meteorology, and
computer science. All of these areas also offer
potential careers for the physics major.
Courses offered introduce the student to the major
physical theories: mechanics, thermodynamics and
statistical physics, electricity and magnetism, and
quantum physics. Additional undergraduate courses
cover optics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, solid
state physics, biological physics, and astrophysics.
Students test the theories in laboratories and
learn experimental techniques needed to work
with modern apparatus such as computers, high-
vacuum equipment, lasers, and electronic and
optical devices.
Active research programs supported by federal
grants and contracts are pursued in the following
fields: acoustics (scattering, nonlinear processes,
and levitation); astrophysics (planetary, stellar,
and galactic structure and evolution); astrophysical
generation of gravitational waves, gravitational
wave data analysis, cosmology; optical properties
of semiconductors; biophysics; nanoscale physics
and materials, Bose-Einstein condensates, cluster
physics; optical physics (femtosecond laser
spectroscopy, scattering from doped polymers,
nonlinear optics, quantum electronics, Fourier
spectroscopy, diffraction catastrophes); physics
education (use of microcomputers in teaching
and labs); nuclear solid state physics (MÖssbauer
effect, perturbed angular correlation, positron
annihilation studies of defects in solids); shock wave
and high pressure physics (chemical and structural
response of condensed materials to high dynamic
pressures, time-resolved optical spectroscopy,
shock and detonation wave propagation, chemical
reactions, dynamic mechanical failure); surface
and chemical physics (synchrotron SAFS, diamond
films, molecular interactions with surfaces,
reactive etching of surfaces, photoelectric and
thermal emission microscopy); theory (quantum
chaos, nonlinear dynamics, mesoscopic systems,
phase transitions and critical phenomena,
quantum liquids and gases, atomic and molecular
physics (ultra-cold atoms, optical pumping,
magnetic resonance), classical and quantum gravity,
black hole thermodynamics, and low-temperature
physics). These research groups offer graduate
students the opportunity to pursue original
investigations required for advanced degrees.
Undergraduate physics majors are encouraged to
participate in research through the special-project
course (PHYSICS 499) and through part-time jobs
that are sometimes available.
The department offers courses of study leading to
the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Physics, Master
of Science in Physics, and Doctor of Philosophy
(Physics).
Astronomy courses at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels are administered by the department.
Instruction in astronomy is enhanced by the use
of a 12-inch telescope at the Jewett Observatory,
the Spitz planetarium, and faculty research at LIGO
gravitational-wave observatory. Opportunities are
available for students to collaborate with faculty to
do research projects.
The Department of Physics and Astronomy is a
major participant in the Materials Science Program
and offers courses and research opportunities
leading to advanced degrees in this interdisciplinary
program.
Student Learning Outcomes
A student who has completed the undergraduate
program in physics will be able to use scientific
reasoning to form and test hypotheses; think
independently and critically in acquiring,
reproducing, and assessing information from
a variety of sources; understand the important
concepts in each of the four core areas of physics:
mechanics, electricity and magnetism, modern
and quantum physics, and thermal and statistical
physics; apply these concepts in mathematical
models to solve theoretical and real-world problems;
design and conduct scientific experiments which
test new ideas and theories; present concepts and
results clearly, both orally and in writing; and
be prepared for graduate study and/or careers in
physics and related fields.
Transfer Students
Transfer students receive credit for equivalent
courses taken elsewhere, but must meet the
requirements for graduation listed.
Preparation for Graduate Study
Undergraduate students contemplating graduate
work in physics should consider enrolling in
PHYSICS 443, 521, 571, and additional math
courses.
Schedules of Studies
Honors students complete the Honors
College requirements which replace the
UCORE requirements.
APPLIED PHYSICS OPTION
(121 CREDITS)
The program of courses below is appropriate
for students who wish to enter industry upon
graduation. The program of courses below is
appropriate for students who have had a good
experience with calculus in high school and wish
to start physics in the first semester at WSU (even
though the student may be placed in MATH 171,
if their high school grades for the year course
were B or better they can follow this schedule of
study). Students who have placed in MATH 172
can accelerate the math sequence. Students who
have not had calculus in high school should defer
PHYSICS 201/211 until they have completed MATH
171. Upon consultation with the departmental
advisor, modifications can be made in the list
of required courses to fit the needs of individual
students. The schedule of studies below includes
the additional lab credit required for graduation by
the College of Arts and Sciences.
Admission to the Major requirements
Students may be admitted to the major upon
making their intentions known to the department.
Graduation Requirements
A research experience is required of all students as
a PHYSICS 489 project; however, to gain valuable
work experience outside the university, students
are strongly encouraged to participate in an
internship or research experience in industry or a
government lab outside of WSU. The summer after
the junior year is the most appropriate time for this
experience. All students are required to submit an
undergraduate thesis to a committee of two physics
faculty members in the senior year. PHYSICS 490
will give credit for this effort. The student must earn
a C (2.0) or better grade in each of the required
physics courses.

202/212, 303, and 304 plus any two courses (6
credits) from the following list: PHYSICS 320, 330,
341, 342, 410, 415 [M], 443, 450, 461, 463, or 465.
This makes a total of 20 credits in PHYSICS, of which
12 are upper division. Credit hours must include 9
hours of upper-division work taken in residence
at WSU or through WSU-approved education
abroad or educational exchange courses. Students
from outside the College of Arts and Sciences (i.e.,

Plant pathology is the study of plant diseases,
including causes, economic consequences, spread,
and control. Opportunities for graduates in plant
pathology include positions in research and
development, teaching, extension, diagnostics, and
sales. Plant pathologists are employed throughout
the world by industries, governments, educational
institutions, and private foundations.
Most opportunities in plant pathology require
advanced degrees. Students who intend to complete
their university training with a baccalaureate degree
are encouraged to enroll in the Agricultural and
Food Systems (Agriculture and Food Security major)
or Integrated Plant Sciences curricula. For more
information on these baccalaureate degrees, please
visit https://cahnrs.wsu.edu/academics/majors/.
The courses offered in this department are designed
both to train students expecting to make plant
pathology their professional field of specialization
and to provide supplementary training for
students in other biological and agricultural fields,
particularly botany, crop science, entomology,
forestry, genetics, and horticulture. Students who
expect to become professional plant pathologists are
advised to include fundamental courses in botany,
chemistry, genetics, microbiology, physics, and
zoology in their undergraduate studies.
A professional career in plant pathology would
benefit from graduate training. Students often
enter the graduate program in plant pathology
following a major in biology, botany, crop science,
genetics, horticulture, molecular biology, or similar
areas as well as in plant pathology. Specialized
areas of advanced study include bacteriology,
mycology, nematology, virology, epidemiology,
molecular biology of host-parasite relationships,
ecology of disease development, disease resistance,
chemical control, and biological control. Research
is conducted on diseases of grain crops, forage
crops, forest trees, tree fruits, grapes, vegetables,
ornamentals, and turf.
The department offers the Master of Science in
Plant Pathology, and Doctor of Philosophy in Plant
Pathology and contributes to the degrees of Bachelor
of Science in Agricultural and Food Systems, Bachelor
of Science in Integrated Plant Sciences, and the
Master of Science in Agriculture online degree.
Preparation for Graduate Study
As preparation for work toward an advanced
degree, a student should have completed a
bachelor’s degree; at least one semester each of
general inorganic chemistry, botany, zoology,
physics; one semester each of systematic botany,
plant physiology, general plant pathology,
entomology, microbiology, precalculus, organic
chemistry, genetics, statistics, and report writing or
advanced composition.
Student Learning Outcomes
To enable students earning the M.S. and Ph.D.
in Plant Pathology to understand and apply the
scientific method to plant pathological problems,
to develop critical thinking and professional
skills needed for successful careers in public and
private sectors, the program provides training and
coursework to help students develop the following
skills:
• Understanding, interpretation, and synthesis of
scientific literature pertaining to plant pathology
and related disciplines
• F o r m u l a t i n g h y p o t h e s e s ; d e v e l o p i n g
experimental designs to test these hypotheses;
establishing and maintaining experiments
• Collecting data in an objective way and
conducting appropriate statistical analyses
• Interpretation and presentation of research
results in oral and written formats
• Presentation of research at professional meetings
and local commodity meetings
• Publication of research in peer-reviewed scientific
journals and other discipline-appropriate outlets
such as commodity newsletters
To maintain a leadership role in plant pathology
and related disciplines at the state, national and
international levels, the program aims to:
• Attract, train, and retain high quality graduate
students

POLITICAL SCIENCE PROGRAM
https://pppa.wsu.edu/undergraduate-studies/b-a-in-
political-science/
Courses in political science are offered in political
institutions (presidency, congress, the courts,
political parties, mass media), public policy
formation and evaluation, public law, civil
liberties, international relations (foreign policy,
security studies, conflict resolution), comparative
government (area studies, post-industrial societies,
cross-national comparisons), political philosophy
and methodology.
The School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public
Affairs (PPPA) offers courses of study leading to
the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Political Science,
Master of Arts in Political Science (General), Master
of Arts in Political Science (with a Graduate
Certificate in Global Justice and Security Studies),
and Doctor of Philosophy.
The undergraduate programs in Political Science
are designed to prepare students to be more
thoughtful consumers and producers of information
related to political phenomenon in the U.S. and in
other nations.
Student Learning Outcomes
More specifically, the school’s programs teach
students to:
• Be able to use creative thinking, critical thinking
and sound reasoning with respect to political and
policy-related questions, including the use of the
principles of the scientific method to enhance and
create knowledge.
• Be able to understand and use qualitative,
quantitative, and mixed research methods and be
able to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of
methods for assessing various political and policy-
related questions.
• Be able to demonstrate a comprehensive
understanding of political and policy-related
subjects, including the relevance of political science
to contemporary, real-world problems.
• Be able to identify, evaluate, use responsibly, and
share data and information regarding a political or
policy-related question.
• Be able to effectively communicate through
written, oral, and other media as appropriate for
the audience and purpose.
• Be able to understand, respect, and engage with
others of similar and diverse cultures, values, and
perspectives.
Options within the B.A. in Political
Science: General Option, Prelaw Option,
and Global Politics Option
General: The General Option in the Political
Science B.A. provides diverse training in American
politics, comparative and international politics,
policy and public administration, and a wide range
of elective courses in political science.
No specific major is required to be eligible for law
school, but political science is widely recognized as
an excellent academic preparation for law school.
The CAS Prelaw Advising Center assists all students
interested in law school regardless of their intended
major.
Pre-Law: The Political Science Prelaw Option
is designed to prepare students for law school and
eventual careers in law. This curriculum reflects
recommendations of the Association of American
Law Schools.
Global Politics: This option emphasizes
comparative and international politics and includes
an international experience that can be fulfilled
through study abroad, an international internship,
a minor in a foreign language or global studies, or
ROTC.
Government is the nation’s largest employer.
Many public officials are political science graduates.
The school advises students concerning training
and career opportunities in federal, state, and
local governments, the Foreign Service, and
related occupations. Its internship programs place
students in public agencies, political parties, and
similar organizations. The school also encourages
and advises students on study abroad as part of
preparing for careers in international affairs.
Preparation for Graduate Study
https://pppa.wsu.edu/graduate-studies/
Students with some undergraduate course work in
political science while majoring in such subjects
as economics, business administration, history,
criminal justice or sociology may readily pursue
graduate study in political science. Undergraduates
at other institutions or in other programs at this
institution who contemplate graduate work in this
program should acquire some training in political
science. For graduate study and its graduate degree
programs, our students currently choose from one
major foundational training area within which they
will focus for their preliminary exams (Institutions
and Processes; Behavior and Psychology; Theory
and Philosophy), as well as a specialization field
(American politics; Global politics; Public Policy/
Public Administration).
PHILOSOPHY PROGRAM
https://pppa.wsu.edu/undergraduate-studies/b-a-in-
philosophy/
The Philosophy program in the School of Politics,
Philosophy, and Public Affairs offers courses in
which students discuss fundamental intellectual
questions and both classical and contemporary
attempts to address them. What makes for a morally
right act or a just society? What sorts of things can
we really claim to know? What is mind, and what
is its relation to matter? Are we really capable of free
choice or is our every act determined by past events?
These are the kinds of questions that are addressed
by philosophers.
Philosophy students acquire knowledge of ethics,
logic, political philosophy, philosophy of religion,
epistemology, metaphysics, and other areas that
provide excellent intellectual foundations for
careers in law, government service, education,
ministry, and many other fields. This is reflected in
the fact that philosophy majors, on average, perform
better than any other major on professional and
graduate school admission tests that are required for
admission to law school, medical school, business
administration programs, and graduate school.
The study of philosophy enables students to
explore critically a variety of systems of beliefs and
values, to identify and challenge the foundations of
their own beliefs and values, and to develop critical
thinking and communication skills that are in high
demand and central to success in all professions.
The School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public
Affairs offers programs of study leading to the
Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy (in either the General
Option or the Pre-Law Option) and the Graduate
Certificate in Bioethics.
Student Learning Outcomes
More specifically, the school’s programs teach
students to:
• Be able to use critical and creative thinking skills
with respect to philosophical topics, and be able
to construct reason-based arguments in support of
one’s positions.
• Be able to develop an integrative understanding
of the sciences and humanities.
• Be able to identify and clarify key issues and
questions in theoretical and real-world contexts.
• Be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of
the philosophical canon and critical thinking/logic
frameworks.
• Be able to apply critical thinking frameworks and
argument analysis to identify, locate, and evaluate
sources when doing group work and independent
research.
• Be able to effectively communicate through
written, oral, and other media as appropriate for
the audience and purpose.
• Be able to understand, respect, and engage with
others of similar and diverse cultures, values, and
perspectives.
Options within the B.A. in Philosophy:
General Option and Prelaw Option
General: The General Option provides broad
training in philosophy, including an emphasis on
the history of philosophical thought.
Pre-Law: The Philosophy Pre-Law Option is
designed to prepare students for law school and
eventual careers in law. This curriculum emphasizes
ethics, political philosophy, and critical thinking,
and it reflects recommendations of the Association
of American Law Schools. Students choosing
other school options are also eligible to attend law
school if they meet admission requirements, but
philosophy is widely recognized as an excellent
academic preparation for law school.
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
https://cas.vancouver.wsu.edu/public-affairs
The Public Affairs degree is offered at the
undergraduate level exclusively on the WSU
Vancouver Campus. The Bachelor of Arts in Public
Affairs (BAPA) seeks to develop critical thinking
about political and social values and develop the
ability to conduct objective analysis of public
infrastructures and bureaucratic processes. The
degree program is designed to educate people
for service in public and nonprofit agencies and
to prepare students for graduate or law school.
In addition to core courses, students complete
a concentration in public policy and politics,
public administration and management, or justice
studies. The program’s multidisciplinary perspective
provides for the blending of theory, methodology,
and experience in an academically rigorous degree
format.
Student Learning Outcomes
Studying Public Affairs enables students to become
ethical, engaged and competent professionals, in
public administration, public management and
Politics, Philosophy, and Public Affairs

public policy. Graduates from our programs are
well prepared for careers in public service at the
local, state, national or global levels, or for pursuing
further studies. The program offers an intersection
between rigorous academic research and practical
application. Our goal is to foster evidence-based
reasoning and practice on the part of those working
for the public good, including students, community
members, legislators, practitioners, scholars, and
issue stakeholders.
Students in public affairs are expected to
demonstrate learned capacity in the universally
required competencies of the Network of Schools of
Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA)
as appropriate for the student’s level of study (i.e.
undergraduate or graduate). NASPAA’s universal
required competencies include the following:
• To lead and manage in public governance;
• To participate in and contribute to the policy
process;
• To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve
problems and make decisions;
• To articulate and apply a public service
perspective; and
• To communicate and interact productively with a
diverse and changing workforce and citizenry.

preparation for application to dental schools through
the Health Professions Student Center (HPSC). health.
professions@wsu.edu.
Becoming a dentist requires a program of graduate
study in dental school as well as undergraduate
prerequisite coursework. No particular major is
required, and students are more likely to excel in
majors they enjoy. Adequate latitude exists in the
dental schools’ requirements so that the Health
Professions Specialist is able to suggest a schedule of
studies to meet the needs of the individual student.
Typically, the coursework in each of the following
areas will meet the requirements of almost all
institutions and prepare students for the Dental
Aptitude Test (DAT).
The Health Professions Specialists in the Health
Professions Student Center assist all students
regardless of major, who have an interest in a health
care profession in meeting their goal. The HPSC
will assist students in the selection of appropriate
classes and a plan of study to meet the requirements
of the dental schools to which they intend to apply.
Admission to a school of dentistry is based on
satisfactory completion of the entrance requirements
of that school, attainment of satisfactory scholastic
record, satisfactory to exceptional scores on the
Dental Admission Test (DAT), the possession of
personal qualifications necessary for the study
of dentistry, and exemplary letters of reference.
Most schools also require applicants to appear
for a personal interview and demonstrate manual
dexterity development.
The Learning Goals for the Pre-dental curriculum
are based on the WSU Learning Goals of the
Baccalaureate and can be identified as (1) acquire
and assimilate the disciplinary knowledge that is
essential to successful careers as dental students
and dentists (2) reason critically (3) develop lifelong

Pre-Law Curriculum
prelaw.wsu.edu
Students interested in legal education may prepare
for entrance into the law field or law school from
any major in any college at the University. The
American Bar Association recommends attaining
as rich an undergraduate education as possible,
and developing skills in reading, writing, critical
thinking, oral communication, research, and task
management. In most cases, preparing for a career in
law requires success on the Law School Admissions
Test (LSAT), grade point average, personal
statement, letters of recommendation, community
involvement and leadership, alongside rigorous
course work. While no major is recommended
and there are no set requirements for your
undergraduate education, the field of Law and Law
School Admission is highly competitive and success
in these areas depends on careful preparation.
Students interested in considering the law field
should make an appointment with a pre-law advisor
through the Pre-Law Resource Center (Bryan Hall
310; email: prelaw@wsu.edu). Students interested in
law as an area of study, can pursue one of the three
undergraduate programs at the University which

Public Health is the field invested in the protection
and improvement of the health of people and
the communities they belong to. The goals of the
field are to promote and support healthy lifestyles,
understand disease, educate about injury prevention,
and detect, prevent, and respond to the threat
of infectious diseases. Overall, it is concerned
with the health of population groups, from small
neighborhoods to large countries or entire regions of
the world. WSU’s Public Health faculty is engaged in
research with numerous foci including epidemiology,
women’s health, vector-borne disease, and HIV.
Public Health sponsors the Bachelor of Science degree
at the undergraduate level.
The undergraduate program for majors is designed
for students interested in preparing for a career in the
broad realm of public health, including medicine
and other healthcare professions, health education,
environmental health monitoring, health policy
and administration, and more. Graduates earning
the BS degree in Public Health are well prepared
to enter the workforce in the public health arena
of their choice, or attend graduate or professional
school, pursuing an MPH, PhD, or a professional
health degree such as MD, DVM, or PharmD.
The infectious disease option leverages the
expertise of the Washington Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory and the Paul G. Allen
School for Global Health on the Pullman
campus. In addition to core courses in population
health, health systems, methods, biostatistics,
h e a l t h c o m m u n i c a t i o n s , e n v i r o n m e n t a l
health administration, and community health
development, students in the infectious disease
option will be educated in epidemiology, infectious
disease testing, vaccinology/vaccine development,
data management, statistical analysis, and
bioinformatics. Similarly, the behavioral health
option with its emphasis on addiction science would
leverage existing expertise at WSU Spokane and
WSU Vancouver. In addition to the core curriculum
as described above, students will be educated in
fundamental tenants of behavioral health, the
theoretical underpinnings of substance use disorder,
the complex interactions between physical and
mental health, and the behavioral antecedents and
correlates of chronic health conditions.ed pre-PT/
OT or pre-PA specialist in the HPSC.
Student Learning Outcomes
• Locate, use, evaluate, and synthesize public
health information to inform evidence-based
decision making and drive impactful interventions.
• Effectively communicate public health
information, in both oral and written forms and
through a variety of media, to diverse audiences.
• Analyze the various cultural contexts in which
Public Health professionals operate including
factors that influence public health-related practices,
beliefs, and behaviors within diverse communities.
• Develop proficiency in navigating ethical
decision making within the realm of Public Health
to benefit the well-being of both individuals and
communities.
• Advocate effectively for protection and
promotion of the public’s health, demonstrating
a comprehensive understanding of strategies and
policies essential for promoting the well-being of
communities.
Transfer Students
Transfer students must satisfy all of the program
requirements for graduation. Courses taken at other
institutions will be evaluated and credits accepted
where possible. Students who are planning to
transfer to the Public Health program at Washington
State University from other institutions should
review their academic plans with a Public Health
program advisor to establish a schedule of studies
leading to the bachelor’s degree prior to transfer in
order to minimize the time required at Washington
State University to complete bachelor’s degree
requirements. This is desirable because equivalent
coursework to the required PUBHLTH courses is
not available at many other institutions. Inquiries
concerning specific questions are welcomed.
Transfer students are strongly encouraged to enroll
in math and chemistry classes at the appropriate
level to meet the program requirements prior to
transferring. Inquiries should be directed to the
Interim Director.
Schedules of Studies
Honors students complete the Honors
College requirements which replace the
UCORE requirements.

Sociology is the scientific study of social life. Sociology
provides fundamental insight on social matters.
Because our lives are affected by our place in the
social world, the discipline seeks to understand the
connection between people and society. Sociologists
study and work across a broad range of issues - from
inequality to health, from deviance to family, from
work to gender and race. Few fields offer students
opportunities of such breadth.
Courses in sociology are designed to provide
the student with an understanding of what makes
individuals and groups behave the way they do.
Social inequality, social order, and social change
are prominent themes. In today’s changing job
market, the skills developed by sociology majors
are important – skills in analyzing problems,
understanding diverse peoples, and assessing
how changes in the broader social structure shape
individuals’ daily lives. Sociology also provides
training in social science research methods and
statistics, communication, and critical thinking.
Successful sociology majors enter the professional
world with skills useful in a wide range of careers
including public relations, community planning,
positions in government and social agencies, as
researchers and data analysts, criminal justice
system professions, health and medical fields,
and business. Sociology also provides an excellent
foundation for professions that may require
graduate school training, such as counseling, law,
public policy and administration, social work,
public health or teaching.
The department offers courses of study leading to
the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Sociology, Master
of Arts in Sociology, and Doctor of Philosophy. It also
offers an undergraduate minor in Sociology, a minor
in At-Risk Youth, a minor in Workplace Diversity,
a minor in Health and Society, and, in partnership
with the Carson College of Business, a certificate in
Organizational Leadership in Sustainability.
Undergraduate Student Learning
Outcomes
At the completion of the bachelor of arts degree
in sociology, students will be able to: (1) define and
analyze social problems and identify the structural
and cultural factors that contribute to social and
individual outcomes; (2) understand and apply basic
statistics to social issues, including how to interpret,
and draw appropriate conclusions from social science
data presented in tables, charts, and graphs, as well
as apply quantitative knowledge to present social
science data in various forms (graphs, tables, words.
etc.); (3) Identify, analyze, and explain the causes and
consequences of social inequality across multiple
dimensions and social institutions; (4) clearly
communicate sociological concepts, theories, and
findings through writing and speaking; (5) identify,
assess, explain, and conduct social science research
including learning the skills of research design,
data collection, sampling, and measurement. (6)
identify sources of social science research and assess
it when reported in both professional and popular
publications and use social science to develop
informed judgements; (7) analyze the relationships
between social, technological, and natural physical
systems; and (8) put into practice the skills and habits
of successful professionals.
Schedules of Studies
Honors students complete the Honors
College requirements which replace the
UCORE requirements.
SOCIOLOGY
(120 CREDITS)
A student may be admitted to the Sociology
program upon making their intentions known to
the department.
This is a prototype of one of many ways to
complete the Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in four
years. The program has built-in flexibility.
A Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology requires
a minimum of 31 credits of sociology coursework
in which students must maintain a C average. All
majors must complete five required core courses:
Introduction to Sociology (SOC 101), Development
of Social Theory (SOC 310), Research Methods in
Sociology (SOC 317 [M]), Quantitative Techniques
in Sociology (SOC 321), and one of the following
“capstone experience” integrative capstone courses:
Internship Capstone (SOC 495 [CAPS][M]), From
Theory to Practice Capstone (SOC 496 [CAPS][M]),
or Research Practicum Capstone (SOC 497 [CAPS]
[M]).
Students must also complete 15 credits of
elective courses in sociology and 12 credits in
a concentration area, half of which must be in
300-400-level courses. Concentration courses
enable students to individualize their programs
of study to best meet their academic and career
goals. Students select concentration courses from a
department-approved list and in consultation with
an academic advisor.

The Minor in Workplace Diversity program
is designed specifically for students and/or
professionals with the aim of preparing them
for increasingly diverse and global workplaces. It
increases their intercultural understanding and
skills, as well as provides evidence of those skills
(in the form of an academic minor) to prospective
or current employers. Given the possibility of
following a number of profession-specific tracks, the
program is useful for individuals across majors or
disciplines who are or expect to be in management
positions, or work with diverse colleagues, clients,
customers, patients, or students.
The intent of this minor is to broaden and
enhance knowledge and/or incorporate additional

Certificates
Sustainable Organizational
Leadership
The Certificate in Sustainable Organizational
Leadership at WSU is open to all majors. This
interdisciplinary certificate provides value
to students by building synergies across two
strongly complementary units: the Department
of Sociology and the Carson College of Business.
Environmental and resource sustainability is an
important social problem and an increasingly
common issue across for-profit, not-for-profit, and
governmental workplaces. Achieving sustainability
requires attention to the intersections of three key
domains – financial, environmental, and social.
This certificate will develop student expertise and
skills in these three arenas and the intersections
between them, producing leaders who can act to
achieve sustainability goals across a diversity of
organizational settings.
The Certificate in Sustainable Organizational
Leadership requires 15 credits including SOC 332,
340, and MGMT 301, and two electives drawn from:
HBM 381 or MGMT 401; MGMT 483, 487; SOC 230,
335, 336, 474.

TEACHER CERTIFICATION
The Department of Teaching and Learning prepares
individuals to teach elementary education, and
various single subjects at the secondary education
level. The teaching certificate, awarded by the
State Superintendent of Public Instruction upon
recommendation by Washington State University,
designates the subject area in which the certificate
holder is qualified to teach. Admission to the
teacher education programs at all campuses is
selective. Teacher education is offered at the Pullman,
Spokane, Tri-Cities, and Vancouver campuses,
although not all programs are available at each site.
The teaching certificate will be awarded if the
following provisions are met:
1. The candidate provides evidence of
good character and personal fitness to teach.
Fingerprinting is required. A background
investigation is conducted by the Washington State
Patrol, the FBI, and Office of Professional Practices.
2 . T h e d e g r e e i s a w a r d e d a n d t h e
professional education program is satisfactorily
completed following these guidelines:
• All course work is taken for a letter grade where
offered. Pass, Fail grading is not accepted except for
field experience courses.
• The candidate has earned no grade lower than C
(2.0) for professional course work, and course work in
the endorsements. The C minimum grade also applies
to general education, math, science, and social studies
requirements in the elementary program.
• The cumulative WSU GPA and the GPA computed
separately for professional course work and each
endorsement is not less than 2.5.
• The student has completed all work within five
years of admission to teacher education. Those not
finishing within this time limit will be subject to all
new program requirements.
• The candidate has achieved a passing score
or demonstrated basic skills on the statewide
examinations in basic skills (WEST-B, SAT, or ACT),
content (WEST-E or NES).
• The candidate has met the Professional
Dispositions Assessment standards.
Transfer students entering an undergraduate
or post-baccalaureate certificate program must
complete at least fifty percent of the professional
education core, and, if preparing to teach at the
elementary level, fifty percent of the elementary
endorsement course work, plus student teaching
at WSU. Transfer students and post-baccalaureate
applicants should consult with an advisor regarding
equivalency and transferability of course work.
Opportunities are provided for teacher certificate
candidates to gain meaningful experiences by
working directly with and observing children in
school settings. It is WSU’s intent to place only
those individuals in K-12 classrooms that are able to
demonstrate a positive impact on student learning,
and to ensure that they possess those characteristics
desirable for working with children and young
people. The College of Education therefore reserves
the right to refuse placement of any student in a
field experience, or to terminate an individual’s
placement if in the professional judgment of the
faculty, the hosting school, or coordinating field
personnel there is cause for concern about the
fitness of that individual to work with children
in a classroom setting. The student teaching field
placement is arranged by the faculty with school
districts contracted to provide experiences for WSU
students. Students do not make their own student
teaching placements. Student teaching must be
completed at an approved WSU site in the state of
Washington or internationally with supervision by
an approved WSU provider.

Bustad 110
509-335-1532
The College of Veterinary Medicine offers courses of
study leading to the degrees of Doctor of Veterinary
Medicine (DVM), Master of Science, and Doctor of
Philosophy. Additional information, including
requirements for admission, is contained in the
general information section of this catalog.
The professional DVM program offered by the
College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington
State University is accredited by the Council on
Education of the American Veterinary Medical
Association.
DOCTOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
A minimum of seven years is generally necessary
to obtain the degree of Doctor of Veterinary
Medicine (DVM). Most successful applicants have
completed three to four years of undergraduate
education. Following undergraduate studies, a
student then takes four years of professional study
directed by the College of Veterinary Medicine.
Applicants for admission to the College of
Veterinary Medicine must complete at least 63
semester credits of acceptable prerequisite credits
from an accredited college or university. The
63 semester credits should include: 35 credits
of science and math prerequisites, including
general biology, inorganic and organic chemistry,
biochemistry, physics, mathematics, genetics, and
statistics; and 27 credits of University Common
Requirements (UCORE): 21 credits of social science,
arts and humanities, history, diversity studies,
language, etc.; and 6 credits of English composition
and communication (written or verbal). Non-
academic criteria for admission include clinical,
animal, employment, volunteer, and research
experience; honors, awards, and scholarships;
extracurricular activities, community service, letters
of recommendation, personal statements, and may
include a personal interview.
Courses designed to fit the academic requirements
are offered by Washington State University, and
the number of students admitted to undergraduate
courses is not limited. Because the number of
applicants for admission to the DVM program
exceeds the number that can be admitted, no
assurance can be given that all applicants who
successfully complete the undergraduate curriculum
will be admitted. WSU does not grant a BS in pre-
veterinary medicine. Students taking pre-veterinary
course work may declare a major in any subject.
Many successful applicants major in animal science,
biology, chemistry, microbiology, neuroscience,
wildlife ecology, zoology, or other science-related
fields.
A major in veterinary medicine is not declared
until admission to the College of Veterinary
Medicine has been granted.
Information regarding the acceptability of course
credits should be obtained from the Office of DVM
Admissions, College of Veterinary Medicine.
ADMISSION TO THE DVM PROGRAM
A student seeking to enter the professional DVM
program should fill out a Veterinary Medical College
Application Service (VMCAS) application at http://
www.aavmc.org/Students-Applicants-and-Advisors/
Veterinary-Medical-College-Application-Service.
aspx) designating WSU as a school of choice
and answering any supplemental questions as
appropriate. Please see https://vetmed.wsu.edu/
education/dvm/ for further application information.
The Admissions Committee selects those students
to be admitted to the first year of the professional
DVM program. Applicants will be notified of their
acceptance on or before April 15th. Unsuccessful
applicants who wish to be considered the next year
must submit new applications.
In accordance with policies adopted by the
Board of Regents, preference for admission to
the professional DVM program in the College of
Veterinary Medicine is as follows:
• To qualified applicants who are certified and
financed as residents of Washington, Idaho,
Montana, or Utah.
• To qualified applicants certified and financed
by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher
Education (WICHE) contract states.
• To all other qualified applicants.
PRE-ADMITTANCE PROGRAMS
A highly selective program for admission of
academically qualified students to the DVM
program at Washington State University College of
Veterinary Medicine has been established with the
WSU Honors College. This program conditionally
admits successful applicants directly to the program
upon completion of one year of undergraduate
work at WSU. This is a pre-admit program leading
to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree after
satisfactory completion of a designed curriculum.
It consists of three years of a unique undergraduate
pre-professional education and the four-year
professional DVM program. The first three years of
this program are a combination of Honors College
courses and regular University classes which fulfill
the pre-veterinary requirements plus the completion
of an honors thesis. The last four years are the

traditional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program.
Interested students should identify themselves to
the Honors College as soon as they decide to enter
WSU, because the number of positions is limited.

Veterinary Medicine - See Department of Animal
Sciences.
Schedules of Studies
Honors students complete the Honors

The PhD and MS programs in Clinical and
Translational Science provide education and
training in biomedical science with an emphasis
on Veterinary Medicine and applications to clinical
medicine. The research environment includes
faculty with both clinical and basic research interests
and provides a unique environment for application
of fundamental biomedical principles to solving
important clinical problems. The Clinical Sciences
graduate group offers MS and PhD programs
focused on training scientists to have broad
expertise in appropriate concepts, theories, and
emerging methods to effectively conduct research
across the disciplines represented in Veterinary
Clinical Sciences. To fully understand “health”
and appropriate interventions at population and
individual levels through studies ranging from the
molecular (genetics, pharmacogenetics, molecular
epidemiology, bacterial genome characterization),
cellular (mechanisms of tumor cell resistances),
systems (orthopedics, theriogenology), mechanism
of disease (oncology, neurology), populations
(epidemiology, gene flow within populations,
disease rates), and evaluation of disease
interventions (clinical trials, observational studies).
The MS program may also be paired with advanced
clinical training where the student participates in
post-DVM clinical training with the goal of specialty
board certification enhanced by training in clinical
research methods.
The department also offers two Graduate
certificate programs 1.) Veterinary Clinical
Internship Certificate Program, and 2.) Veterinary
Clinical Residency Certificate Program. Veterinary
Clinical Internship and Veterinary Clinical
Residency Graduate Certificate Programs provide
formal recognition for the internship and residency
programs. Graduate certificate programs are
intended to provide post-baccalaureate students
with multi-course training programs in specialized
areas that help professionals gain new skills and
knowledge and advance their careers. The clinical
internship and residency program is a one-year
(internship) to three-year (residency) post-DVM
training program that is intended to prepare
graduate veterinarians for high-quality clinical
service or advanced specialty training (internship),
and to provide advanced specialty training
(residency). The graduate certificate for interns
requires a minimum of 20 credits obtained over two
semesters, with a course load of 10 credits/semester.
The certificate for residents will require a minimum
of 60 credits obtained over six semesters (course load
of 10 credits/semester) for three years with a course
load of 10 credit hours/semester.

Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) is
an interdisciplinary field of research and teaching
that places gender and sexuality at the center of
inquiry. In WGSS courses students work together
to explore the ways that race, ethnicity, sexuality,
social class, nationality, age, and ability intersect
to shape gendered experience, injustice, and social
change. Using an intersectional lens, students
gain expertise in analyzing gendered social roles
and the ways in which they affect personal lives,
artistic expression, work, relationships, institutional
structures, the production of knowledge, and
national and international political and economic
relations. WGSS offers a Bachelor of Arts in
Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and
minors in Women’s Studies and Queer Studies. The
program is administered through the Department of
English. Students interested in declaring a major or
minor should contact the program director, Pamela
Thoma, professor of English.
