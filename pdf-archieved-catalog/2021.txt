A. Balazs, Major C. Rocco, Major\nP. Hyde, Captain B. O’Neill.\nAir Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC)\nAFROTC is a nationwide program that allows\nfull-time college students to pursue military\ncommissions and become officers in the United\nStates Air Force (USAF) and United States Space\nForce (USSF) while simultaneously attending\nuniversity. AFROTC classes are held on college\ncampuses throughout the United States and Puerto\nRico, and students can register through normal\ncourse registration processes.\nThe AFROTC program consists of four years of\nAerospace Studies classes, to include: Heritage\nand Values, Team and Leadership Fundamentals,\nLeading People and Effective Communication,\nand National Security, Leadership Responsibilities,\nand Commissioning Preparation. Each of the\nfour years is accompanied by a corresponding\nLeadership Laboratory course. During Leadership\nLaboratory, students apply leadership skills,\ndemonstrate command principles, practice effective\ncommunication skills, develop physical fitness,\nand learn military customs and courtesies. College\nstudents pursuing a military commission are\nenrolled in the AFROTC program as “cadets”. Upon\nsuccessful completion of AFROTC training and\ncollege degree requirements, cadets will graduate\nand commission as Second Lieutenants in the\nActive-Duty component of the USAF or the USSF.\nThe AFROTC program is currently offered\nat Washington State University, but there are\nagreements that allow University of Idaho, Lewis-\nClark State College, and Whitworth University\nstudents to enroll in AFROTC and become full-\nfledged cadet participants. Students interested\nin learning about military culture, but not in\npursuing a military commission, are eligible to\nenroll in the Heritage and Values or Team and\nLeadership Fundamentals courses as participating\nstudents rather than cadets.

It’s a tall order by any measure, but\nespecially when you consider that experts predict\nthat by 2050, the world population will grow to\nmore than 9 billion human beings. Join WSU’s\nAgricultural and Food Systems (AFS) degree program\nand focus on vital aspects of agricultural and food\nsystems ranging from plant and animal production\nto marketing and education. This innovative\nprogram provides students with what they need\nto build or work in a modern food system that is\nproductive, competitive and sustainable.\nDelivered collaboratively by departments within\nthe College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural\nResource Sciences, the AFS program provides\nfoundational education in a wide array of disciplines,\nincluding crop and soil sciences, animal science,\nfood science, horticulture, entomology, plant\npathology, and economics. Students can choose\namong five Bachelor of Science degree majors:\nAgricultural Education; Agricultural Technology\nand Production Management; Agricultural and\nFood Business Economics; Agriculture and Food\nSecurity; and Organic and Sustainable Agriculture.\nThe college offers a minor in Agricultural Systems,\nwhich is specifically designed to complement a\nmajor in Communications, for students interested\nin careers in the communications sector of the\nagricultural industry. The college also offers an\ninterdisciplinary Master of Science in Agriculture\ndegree, an undergraduate Certificate in Organic\nAgriculture, and a graduate Certificate in Sustainable\nAgriculture.\nA student may be admitted to an AFS major upon\nmaking their intention known to the department.\nFor complete information about all majors within\nthe AFS degree programs, please see the AFS webpage\nat: http://afs.wsu.edu.\nBachelor of Science in Agricultural and\nFood Systems (Pullman campus)\nSystems not silos. The AFS degree program\nemphasizes the highly integrated nature of the\nscience disciplines involved in growing food.\nAll students take a core set of courses designed\nto provide them with a broad interdisciplinary\nbackground as well as the decision-making skills\nthey’ll need to succeed and excel in the workplace.\nCapstone courses. At the end of their program, most\nstudents take an AFS capstone course. Agricultural\nEducation students take a teaching experience\ncapstone. These capstone courses are designed\nspecifically to provide a culminating experience\nto help in preparing students to be “job-ready, day\none”. In the standard AFS capstone guest lectures\nfrom industry professionals challenge students on\ntopics including developing your personal brand,\nproject management, sales 101, private agricultural\n\n54\nAgricultural and Food Systems\nWashington State University, 2021\nbusiness ownership and succession planning, and\nthe performance review process. A fundamental\npart of the capstone experience is a team-based,\nsemester-long project where small groups of\nstudents each work on addressing an emerging\nissue or problem and providing recommendations\nto one of several industry partners (co-ops, private\ncompanies, etc.). Students meet regularly with\nindustry partners (face-to-face, videoconference,\nphone) to define their project, collect research\ninformation and develop a project plan. They\nprepare meeting agendas, take minutes and report\nback to instructors to identify what worked, what\ndid not work, and what changes they plan to\nmake for the next meeting. Besides introducing\nstudents to their business and colleagues, industry\npartners provide in-house research background\ninformation, assist in distributing employee surveys\nand provide excellent professional mentoring for\nstudents. At the end of the semester, student teams\nprovide both a comprehensive written report\nand an oral presentation about their project and\nindustry recommendations both to their peers and\nto industry leaders. In the teaching experience\ncapstone (Agricultural Education majors) students\nteach their last semester as their internship in\neducation. Students are required to complete the\nTeacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) as part\nof the course. Additionally, Agricultural Education\nstudent teachers supervise students in and outside of\na classroom and laboratory setting. Extensive lesson\nplanning, materials preparation, SAE (Supervised\nAgricultural Experience) supervision, FFA activity\ninvolvement, and professional engagement are\nmajor components of the field experience of student\nteaching.\nIn addition to WSU’s Six Learning Goals of the\nBaccalaureate, graduates with a major in AFS will\nbe able to:\n• Agricultural Systems: Identify the basic human,\nsocioeconomic, environmental, and biophysical\ndimensions of agricultural and food systems at the\nlocal, regional, and global levels.\n• Apply systems thinking and principles to explore\nlinkages and leverage points in agricultural and food\nsystems.\n• Describe how physical, social, and political\nfactors impact global agriculture and food systems.\n• Scientific Reasoning: Describe the context\nand scientific basis of current practice and future\nchanges in agricultural and food systems.\n• Interpret and integrate basic and applied science\nknowledge to explain and evaluate agricultural and\nfood systems.\n• Collect, analyze and interpret scientific data to\ninform decision making.\n• Discern appropriate scientific evidence and\nresearch to inform decisions.\n• Critical Thinking: Evaluate real-world\nagricultural and food systems and paradigms\nconsidering agricultural science, social, economic,\nand environmental outcomes.\n• Obtain and apply scholarly information to\nexpand student understanding and knowledge of\nagricultural systems.\n• Identify the scientific, cultural, economic, and\nenvironmental context and diverse perspectives\ninfluencing agricultural food systems.\n• Understand the students’ own values and\nperspectives in shaping agricultural food systems.\n• Draw conclusions and make recommendations\nbased on an understanding of the system, scientific\nevidence, contextual factors, and desired outcomes.\n• Science and Professional Communication:\nCommunicate scientific principles, research, and\nfindings to diverse audiences.\n• D e l i v e r p r o f e s s i o n a l o r a l a n d w r i t t e n\ncommunication.\n• Use graphic representation to present data and\nscientific findings.\n• Work effectively as a member of a team and\ncollaboratively across disciplines.\n• Depth (Major-Level Outcome): Demonstrate\nmajor-specific mastery of a topic with specialized\nknowledge and skills in at least one area of inquiry\nwithin the AFS degree.\nAgricultural Education\n• Demonstrate the necessary subject matter\nknowledge for success as an agricultural teacher.\n• Develop and deliver effective lessons based upon\nsound pedagogy and student needs in a culturally\nresponsive manner.\n• Construct, analyze, and appraise formative and\nsummative assessment data in order to inform\nteaching practice.\n• Implement the components of a complete\nagricultural education program.\nAgricultural and Food Business Economics\n• Apply appropriate economic principles, analysis\nand quantitative methods to analyze problems and\nissues of social importance.\n• Collect, organize, evaluate, and analyze\nappropriate economic data to apply economic\ntheory to AFS managerial problems.\n• Illustrate and communicate analytical results,\nconclusions, and limitations of the econometric\ntesting in real world applications.\nAgriculture and Food Security\n• Being developed by the curriculum committee\nAgricultural Technology and Production\nManagement\n• Being developed by the curriculum committee\nOrganic and Sustainable Agriculture\n• Locate, access, and interpret principles and\ncertification guidelines (if applicable) of organic and\nother agroecological systems, such as integrated,\nconservation agriculture, and mixed croplivestock.\n• Be competent with utilizing important sustainable\nagriculture website sources, including the USDA\nNational Organic Program (NOP), UN Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO), OrganicMaterials\nReview Institute (OMRI) and National Sustainable\nAgriculture Information Service (ATTRA).\n• Understand agricultural sustainability metrics in\nthe areas of social wellbeing, financialperformance,\nenvironmental quality, and productivity for\nmeasuring these components of anyfarming system.\n• Develop the ability to plan, certify, and manage\nproduction on an organic farm, includingpractical\nskills in farm production, marketing, and teamwork.\nHands-on opportunities with the AFS degree are\nnumerous.

Wright.\nThe Department of Animal Sciences offers courses\nof study leading to the degrees of Bachelor of\nScience in Animal Sciences, Master of Science in\nAnimal Sciences, and Doctor of Philosophy (Animal\nSciences). The department participates in the\nJoint Program for Animal Sciences and Veterinary\nMedicine, leading to the degrees of Bachelor of\nScience in Animal Sciences and Doctor of Veterinary\nMedicine.\nBachelor of Science in Animal Sciences\nThe Department of Animal Sciences provides\ntraining in the biological systems important\nto animals, including principles and practices\nassociated with the management and well-being of\nagricultural animal production. Care and well-being\nof companion and laboratory animals is also taught.\nAnimal Scientists at WSU are experts in animal\nnutrition, physiology, reproduction, genetics and\ngenomics, nutrient management, meat and muscle\nbiology, and animal behavior. They bring this\nexpertise to the classroom and to the experiential\nlearning activities offered to our students. Unique\nhands-on learning opportunities with animals\nallow our students to practice and apply what they\nlearn in the classroom. Most departmental faculty\nare engaged in the many multidisciplinary Centers\nacross the WSU campus which provides additional\nbroadening and experiential opportunities for\nundergraduate and graduate students.\nThe undergraduate curriculum prepares graduates\nfor a wide variety of career paths. These paths\ninclude animal production and food processing\n(meats, dairy products, etc.); animal research;\nbiomedical research; wild and zoological animal\ncare; companion animal services; the agricultural\nservice industries (including feed manufacturing\nand sales, pharmaceuticals, artificial insemination,\nagricultural equipment, financial institutions, etc.);\nand government agencies. Graduates of the Animal\nSciences program are well prepared to continue\ntheir education by pursuing graduate or professional\ndegrees in the sciences and veterinary and human\nmedicine fields. Employers seek out graduates in\nAnimal Sciences for their strong foundation in\nscience, practical and technical knowledge of\nanimal care, and hands-on experience with animal\nproduction.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the Bachelor’s Degree in\nAnimal Sciences, it is expected that graduates will\nbe able to:\n• Develop and evaluate animal production and\nmanagement systems by integrating knowledge\nof animal genetics, nutrition, reproduction, and\nother relevant disciplines and applying scientific\nand quantitative reasoning to solve real-world\nchallenges.\n• Locate, critically evaluate, and apply information\nfrom scholarly animal science literature and\nother sources to expand personal understanding\nand knowledge of animal sciences, providing a\nfoundation for lifelong learning.\n• Create and interpret graphs, tables and diagrams\nillustrating scientific data and concepts, and\nunderstand basic concepts relating to the design\n\n60\nAnimal Sciences\nWashington State University, 2021\nand analysis of research in the animal sciences.\n• Communicate effectively, both orally and\nin writing, about animal sciences to a range of\naudiences using appropriate traditional and\nemerging media.\n• Engage actively and effectively in discussion\nof complex issues relevant to animal sciences by\nunderstanding and appreciating:\n• the importance of animals to the health and well-\nbeing of society;\n• economic, environmental, animal welfare,\nand societal impacts of animal production and\nmanagement systems at the local and global levels;\n• varied ethical perspectives on animal practices;\n• the role of science in informing debates.\n• Appreciate the breadth and depth of professional\nopportunities in animal sciences relating to: the\nkeeping of animals for food and fiber production\nand other purposes (e.g., species conservation,\nc o m p a n i o n s h i p , r e s e a rc h a n d t e a c h i n g ,\nbiotechnology, sports); the application of scientific\nprinciples to animal breeding, reproduction,\nfeeding, growth and development, health\nmanagement, housing, handling, and end–product\nsafety and quality.\nDegree Options in Animal Sciences\nStudents in Animal Sciences take a wide variety of\nagricultural and non-agricultural courses, receiving\nin-depth training in the comparative biology of farm\nand companion animals. Students select a degree\noption to coincide with their interests. Each option\nhas both required courses and electives, which allow\nindividual program specialization in areas of animal\nmanagement or pre-veterinary medicine/science.\nThe Animal Management curriculum is designed to\nprovide students with the scientific, technological,\nand practical knowledge, and communication skills\nto make them productive members of the food\nproduction, animal care and related industries. The\nPre-veterinary/Science option is designed to provide\ngraduates with the skills to be successful in the\nbiomedical or veterinary sciences, biotechnology\nor other science related fields.\nThe Animal Management Option emphasizes\nthe business, economic and science-based practical\nmanagement aspects of animal production and\ncare of animals. This option is recommended\nfor students preparing to work in agricultural\nanimal production, companion animal care, or\nagribusiness.\nThe Pre-veterinary/Science Option places\nemphasis on basic science courses. This option\nis recommended for students planning to attend\ngraduate school, apply to the professional program\nleading to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine\nor other post-baccalaureate degree, or work in\ntechnical or specialized areas of animal science,\nsuch as extension, academia, research, technical\nconsulting, or laboratory research.\nMany opportunities outside the classroom are\navailable for students to further their educational\nexperiences. Animal Sciences students are strongly\nencouraged to participate as part-time employees\nin the livestock centers, or in research and teaching\nprograms within the department. Opportunities\nare available to students for on-the-job training in\nprofessional internships within diverse segments\nof the agricultural, companion animal, veterinary,\nbiomedical, or research sectors. The department\noffers experiential learning opportunities with dairy\ncattle, beef cattle, and swine that allow students\nto practice decision making and management\nskills. Active student clubs within the Department\nof Animal Sciences, the College of Agricultural,\nHuman, and Natural Resource Sciences, and the\nuniversity community provide students with\nboth professional and social contacts with faculty\nand other students. Departmental and college\nscholarships are available based on ability, financial\nneed and interest.\nAnimal Sciences courses are attractive to students\nin other majors and from any background. Animal\nSciences courses broaden a student’s knowledge\nof applied and basic biology, agriculture and the\nenvironment, and society in general. Many students\nfind that obtaining a minor in Animal Sciences\ncomplements and adds depth to other majors.\nTransfer Students\nStudents planning to transfer to the Department\nof Animal Sciences, Washington State University,\nfrom community colleges or other institutions\nshould complete as many science, mathematics,\nand University Common Requirements (UCORE)\ncourses as possible prior to transferring.

Grow; Professors\nEmeriti, R. E. Ackerman, W. Andrefsky, Jr., J. H. Bodley,\nT. A. Kohler, W. D. Lipe, N. P. McKee.\nThe curriculum includes courses in the four major\nsubfields of anthropology: archaeology, cultural/\nsocial anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and\nbiological anthropology. These courses familiarize\nstudents with current issues in human evolution,\nlinguistics, the prehistoric development of culture,\nand cultural theory. Undergraduate majors are\nrequired to gain a background in all four of these\nmajor subfields. Graduate students may specialize in\narchaeology, cultural anthropology, or evolutionary\nanthropology. The program in archaeology\nemphasizes research and training in the prehistory\nof the Americas, including the Pacific Northwest\nfrom Alaska to northern California, the Columbia\nPlateau, the Pueblo societies of the Southwest,\nMesoamerica, and the Andes. Faculty research\nemploys ceramic and lithic analysis, paleoeconomic\nand paleoenvironmental approaches including\ngeoarchaeology, paleobotany and zooarchaeology,\nas well as stable isotope analysis, archaeometry\nvia gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and\nmodeling and simulation. The department also\nconducts summer archaeological field schools.\nThe program in cultural anthropology emphasizes\nglobalization, historical ethnography, psychological\nanthropology, medical anthropology, gender\nand culture, biocultural perspectives, and public\nhealth anthropology. Faculty research is based\nin North and Central America, Polynesia, Sub-\nSaharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia.\nThe program in evolutionary anthropology\nemphasizes evolutionary psychology, behavioral\necology, evolutionary cultural anthropology,\nevolutionary archaeology and paleoanthropology.\nEvolutionary faculty have research interests that\nspan several continents including the Americas,\nEurope and Africa. The department also emphasizes\nresearch and training in Psychological/Medical\nAnthropology and Ethnobiology.\nDepartmental offices and laboratories are\nlocated in College Hall near the center of campus.\nPhysical facilities include special laboratories\nfor biological anthropology, isotope and lithic\nanalysis, paleoecology, geoarchaeology, and\nzooarchaeology, as well as research laboratories\nfor faculty and advanced students. The Museum\nof Anthropology, with permanent and temporary\nexhibits, and ethnographic and archaeological\nresearch collections, is also housed in College Hall.\nThe department offers courses of study leading\nto the degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology,\nBachelor of Arts in Human Biology, Master of\nArts in Anthropology, and Doctor of Philosophy\n(Anthropology). Positions open to anthropologists\ninclude those in teaching, research, museum work,\nstate and federal agencies, non-governmental\norganizations, private consulting firms, and\ninternational business. In addition, anthropology\nprovides a strong general foundation for a pre-\nprofessional education.\nHuman Biology\nHuman Biology is an explicitly interdisciplinary\ndegree jointly administered by the Department\nof Anthropology and the School of Biological\nSciences. The BA in Human Biology offers students\nan opportunity to explore how human biology\ninfluences and is influenced by the environment,\ncultural and social structures, and economic and\npolitical policies. Human Biology melds approaches\nand content from social and biological sciences to\nprovide students with a synthetic understanding\nof the roles of culture, the dynamics of natural and\nsocial systems, and biological attributes responsible\nfor shaping the human being. Our aim is to prepare\nstudents to be engaged, creative, insightful, and\nskillful in diverse professions that encompass the\narenas of health and environmental sciences,\nsocietal support, and public policy that influence\nthe welfare of humans.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nWe expect that our graduating students will have:\n• Familiarity with the basic principles and findings\nof ethnology, archaeology, biological anthropology,\nand linguistics, the four subfields of American\nanthropology as well as the ways in which these\nfour subfields are interrelated;\n• Awareness of the basic research and analytical\nmethods and underlying theories of the four\nsubfields of anthropology;\n• Ability to read critically and synthesize\ni n f o r m a t i o n p r o d u c e d b y p r o f e s s i o n a l\nanthropologists and published in academic books\nand journals;\n• Ability to write in accessible, standard, academic\nprose narratives that are marked by: a framework\nof clear, general statements; specific, concrete\nevidence that supports these statements; analysis\nand discussion of the material presented; and a\ncoherent summary conclusion, indicating the\nsignificance of the work;\n• Ability to apply the principles, findings, and\nresearch and analytical methods of anthropology\nto new situations and data, including those of\neveryday life.\nSee https://anthro.wsu.edu/undergraduate-\nstudies/program-learning-goals/.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nANTHROPOLOGY\n(120 HOURS)\nA student may be admitted to the anthropology\nmajor upon making their intention known to the\ndepartment.

Cooperative\narrangements with faculty in units such as Molecular\nBiosciences, Animal Sciences, Environment, and the\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine are readily achieved.\nUndergraduate Programs\nIntroductory biological sciences courses provide\nbackground in the concepts common to life sciences\nand an overview of the diversity of animals, plants,\nand microorganisms. Advanced biological sciences\ncourses probe specific areas in depth. Undergraduate\ncoursework in either biology or zoology prepares\nstudents to pursue career opportunities in ecology\nand environmental biology, laboratory research and\nbiotechnology, human health, animal health and\nwelfare, plant biology, entomology, education, and\na variety of other biological specializations.\nCandidates for the Bachelor of Science in Biology\nor the Bachelor of Science in Zoology must fulfill\nthe University and the College of Arts and Sciences\nrequirements for graduation as described elsewhere\nin this catalog. Requirements for admission to\nthe majors, University degree requirements, and\nthe School and the individual degree option\nrequirements can be found in the individual\nschedules of studies for the degree options.\nWe expect that students graduating with a\nBachelor of Science in Biology or Zoology will\nmeet the following learning outcomes: (1) have a\nmastery of fundamental biological concepts and\nan ability to integrate this conceptual knowledge\nacross different subfields within the discipline; (2)\nuse critical thinking and scientific skills to analyze\nand solve biological problems; (3) effectively\ncommunicate biological problems and solutions to\nthe scientific community and the public at-large in\nwriting and in oral discussion; (4) have the ability\nto formulate logical hypotheses, to test hypotheses\nusing quantitative and other appropriate methods\ninvolving collection and analysis of data, and to\nmake valid inferences from experimental results; (5)\nidentify and access the central body of knowledge\nin biology or zoology through utilization of a wide\nrange of methods for researching the primary\nliterature; (6) use scientific literacy and knowledge\nof biology or zoology to analyze contemporary\nsocial, cultural, and environmental issues to make\ninformed rational decisions.\nBiology\nSeven options are available for the Bachelor of\nScience degree in Biology: general biology, biology\neducation, plant biology, ecology/evolutionary\nbiology, entomology, pre-physical therapy/pre-\noccupational therapy/pre-physician assistant, and\nbasic medical sciences. Each option includes a\ncommon core curriculum plus additional specialized\ncourses. The general biology option provides\nbroad training in the life sciences, particularly for\nstudents seeking to continue in professional or\ngraduate school. The biology education option is\nparticularly suitable for students who would like\nto teach biology at the high school level. The plant\nbiology option is available for students with a\nspecial interest in plants and serves students who\nwould like careers in plant sciences or to pursue\ngraduate studies. The ecology/evolutionary biology\noption provides a concentration on ecological and\nevolutionary biology to address interests in such\nfields as environmental and wildlife biology. The\nentomology option is available for students who\nwish to focus on insect biology. The pre-physical\ntherapy/pre-occupational therapy/pre-physician\nassistant option is designed for students who\nwould like to pursue studies in physical therapy,\noccupational therapy, or physician assistant\nprograms. The basic medical sciences option\nsupports students who aim for a career in the health\nfields, including professional training in medicine,\ndentistry, and pharmacy. This degree has two plans\nof study (Plan A or Plan B). Either will help students\nto meet the requirements for admission to medical,\ndental, or pharmacy schools, or other health science\nprofessional programs. Plan A students have a\nprimary concentration of biological sciences and\na secondary concentration in chemistry. Plan B\nrequires courses from three unrelated areas of\nbiological sciences (biology, molecular bioscience,\nand neuroscience). Students will work with their\nacademic advisor in the School of Biological\nSciences to plan individual courses of study.\nHuman Biology\nHuman Biology is an explicitly interdisciplinary\ndegree jointly administered by the Department\nof Anthropology and the School of Biological\nSciences. The BA in Human Biology offers students\nan opportunity to explore how human biology\ninfluences and is influenced by the environment,\ncultural and social structures, and economic and\npolitical policies. Human Biology melds approaches\nand content from social and biological sciences to\nprovide students with a synthetic understanding\nof the roles of culture, the dynamics of natural and\nsocial systems, and biological attributes responsible\nfor shaping the human being. Our aim is to prepare\nstudents to be engaged, creative, insightful, and\nskillful in diverse professions that encompass the\narenas of health and environmental sciences,\nsocietal support, and public policy that influence\nthe welfare of humans.\nPlease see the Department of Anthropology\nfor degree program requirements, including the\nschedule of studies.\nZoology\nThree options are available for the Bachelor\nof Science degree in Zoology: general zoology,\npre-veterinary/animal care, and pre-medicine/\npre-dentistry.

The flexible\ncurriculum leading to a zoology degree meets the\nneeds of students with various interests and goals.\nThe general zoology option provides a broad, solid\nfoundation in zoology. It is especially aimed at\nstudents desiring a well-rounded background for\nfurther professional studies or for entry into the work\nforce in areas such as wildlife biology or fisheries.\nThe pre-medicine/pre-dentistry option is offered by\nthe School of Biological Sciences as a course program\ndesigned to provide a solid academic foundation\nthat successfully prepares the student for admission\ninto medical, dental, or pharmacy school. The pre-\nveterinary/animal care option prepares students for\ncareers involving animal care and maintenance in\nresearch institutions, zoos, aquaria, and clinics and\nfor application to colleges of veterinary medicine.\nAccelerated Pre-Vet Option in Zoology\nThe School of Biological Sciences has an academic\ntrack that can allow highly qualified students to\nearn both a Bachelor of Science in Zoology and\na Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree within\na seven-year span. Students can enroll in the\nundergraduate zoology program and complete all\nUCORE requirements, the necessary zoology core\ncourses, and all veterinary medicine prerequisite\ncoursework in a three year period. The required\nprerequisites courses can be found on the WSU CVM\nwebsite: https://dvm.vetmed.wsu.edu/admissions/\nprerequisites. Such students who are accepted into\nthe College of Veterinary Medicine DVM program\nafter completing this 3 year program will then be\nallowed to transfer credit back from their first year\nDVM curriculum to fulfill the requirements that will\nallow them to earn a BS in Zoology.\nInterested students must be advised in the School\nof Biological Sciences. High scholastic achievement,\nalong with demonstrated experience and interest\nin working with animals and within the veterinary\nprofession, will be a few of the main criteria for\ninclusion. Interested students should contact the\nSchool of Biological Sciences no later than the first\nsemester of the sophomore year. Students would\nthen declare zoology with the pre-vet option as a\nmajor in the first semester of the sophomore year.\nThe procedures for application into the DVM\nprogram will be the same as those for all other\napplicants to the program (excluding those\napplicants applying to the Early Acceptance\nUndergraduate Programs through the Honors\nCollege or Department of Animal Sciences).\nStudents in this program are not given preferential\nconsideration for admission into the DVM program.\nParticipants who complete the three-year zoology\nprogram, and are accepted into the DVM program\nduring their junior year, will begin the veterinary\nmedicine curriculum in their fourth year of study.\nThese students would complete only the DVM\ncurriculum from this point on, and credits from the\nfirst year of the DVM program will be used to fulfill\nthe remaining requirements that will allow them to\nearn a BS in Zoology. If the student is not accepted\ninto the DVM program or withdraws from it, he/\nshe may continue to earn the BS in Zoology and\nmay be eligible to apply to the College of Veterinary\nMedicine as a senior or following completion of the\nBS.\nTransfer Students\nScience courses taken at other institutions will\nbe evaluated and credits accepted when possible.\nInquiries should be directed to the Associate\nDirector of Undergraduate Programs.\n\n73\nBiological Sciences\nWashington State University, 2021\nGraduate Programs\nAt the graduate level, the school awards Master\nof Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in\nBiology and Plant Biology.

C., Liddell, R. Mahalingam, R. C.\nMiller, W. J. Thomson, R. Zollars.\nThe mission of the Gene and Linda Voiland School\nof Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering is to\ndeliver academic programs in Chemical Engineering\nand Bioengineering that advance the boundaries\nof knowledge, educate competent engineering\nprofessionals, and contribute to the needs of\nsociety. Faculty, staff, and students engage in\ndiscovery, teaching, application, and integration,\nalong with periodic review of achievement, to\ndevelop practitioners and scholars prepared to\nmake meaningful and responsible contributions\nto society.\nThe Program Educational Objectives for\nbaccalaureate degree programs in Chemical\nE n g i n e e r i n g a n d B i o e n g i n e e r i n g d e f i n e\nachievements of which these graduates are capable.\nAs appropriate for their chosen career paths, within\nfive to ten years of graduation, program graduates\nwill be able to:\n• Engage successfully in graduate or professional\neducation or entry-level employment.\n• Perform responsibly and professionally in their\nchosen career paths.\n• Exhibit continued growth of effective\ncommunication and collaboration skills.\n• Demonstrate ongoing development of competent\nand innovative problem solving skills.\n• Continue learning and accept increasing levels\nof responsibility over time.\nThese long-term educational objectives will\nbe achieved through development of our\nStudent Outcomes in a culture of integration\nand engagement. Student Outcomes lay a solid,\nwell-rounded foundation from which to build\nlonger-term capabilities. Systemic integration\nof theory and practice deepens students’\nunderstanding and builds confidence they will need\nfor bold innovation and lifelong learning. Frequent\nengagement of students with peers, faculty, and\nexternal constituencies builds their interpersonal\nskills, refines their understanding, and leads them to\nopportunities for advanced study or employment.\nDedicated faculty who effectively teach, mentor,\nrefer, and model professional behaviors prepare our\ngraduates for the professional world.\nThe school offers courses of study leading to the\ndegrees of Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering,\nBachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering,\n\n111\nChemical Engineering and Bioengineering\nWashington State University, 2021\nMaster of Science in Chemical Engineering, and\nDoctor of Philosophy, with a focus in chemical\nengineering. We also graduate students who receive\nthe Master of Science in Engineering and the Doctor\nof Philosophy in Engineering Science with an\nemphasis in bioengineering.\nChemical Engineering\nThe curriculum in chemical engineering\nprovides thorough knowledge of basic science and\nengineering. This includes material and energy\nbalances, chemical and physical equilibria, rate\nprocesses, and economic balances. With such\ntraining, graduates may participate in the design\nand operation of chemically based products or they\nmay engage in research leading to new or improved\nchemical processes, products, and uses. Graduates\nalso find rewarding work in plant operation, plant\nmanagement, university teaching, sales-service, and\nother functions requiring chemical engineering\ntraining. Many students also use their educations\nin chemical engineering as preparation for other\nprofessional degrees such as medicine or law. The\nchemical engineering program is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,\nwww.abet.org.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nTo guide our student activities in developing\nthe skills to meet the School’s objectives we will\nmonitor their attainment of the Student Outcomes\nas set forth by ABET. These are: 1) an ability to\nidentify, formulate, and solve complex engineering\nproblems by applying principles of engineering,\nscience, and mathematics, 2) an ability to apply\nengineering design to produce solutions that\nmeet specified needs with consideration of public\nhealth, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural,\nsocial, environmental, and economic factors, 3) an\nability to communicate effectively with a range\nof audiences, 4) an ability to recognize ethical\nand professional responsibilities in engineering\nsituations and make informed judgments, which\nmust consider the impact of engineering solutions\nin global, economic, environmental, and societal\ncontexts, 5) an ability to function effectively on a\nteam whose members together provide leadership,\ncreate a collaborative and inclusive environment,\nestablish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives,\n6) an ability to develop and conduct appropriate\nexperimentation, analyze and interpret data, and\nuse engineering judgment to draw conclusions, and\n7) an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as\nneeded, using appropriate learning strategies.\nIn addition to these Outcomes we will also monitor\nthe program criteria for chemical, biochemical,\nbiomolecular or similarly named engineering\nprograms, as set forth by the American Institute\nof Chemical Engineers (AIChE). These criteria are,\nrespectively: “The curriculum must provide (1) a\nthorough grounding in the basic sciences including\nchemistry, physics, and biology, with some content\nat an advanced level, as appropriate to the objectives\nof the program. The curriculum must include (2)\nthe engineering application of these basic sciences\nto the design, analysis, and control of chemical,\nphysical, and/or biological processes, including the\nhazards associated with these processes.” (Numerals\nadded to original AIChE statement).\nSee https://voiland.wsu.edu/undergraduate/che/.\nBioengineering\nBioengineering is an engineering discipline that\nintegrates engineering and life sciences to address\nissues important to human and animal well-being\nand to society at large. As such, the educational\nobjective of the BS Bioengineering degree is to\nprepare graduates for productive employment,\nadvanced study, or professional programs where\nthey apply principles and methods of both\nengineering and life sciences to solve problems\naffecting human and animal health and well-being.\nGraduates may apply their expertise in human and\nanimal medicine, biotechnology, or related biology-\nbased engineering fields.\nWith these integrated science and engineering\nskills, bioengineering graduates are able to make\nvaluable contributions to human and animal\nhealth care and environments, bio-based product\ndevelopment, and biotechnology. At Washington\nState University, bioengineering cooperates with\nand finds applications in numerous disciplines\nof engineering, veterinary medicine, and medical\nsciences. The bioengineering curriculum easily\naccommodates pre-medical, pre-dental, and pre-\nveterinary requirements for those students wishing\nto apply to professional schools in health care fields.\nThe bioengineering program is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,\nwww.abet.org.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nBioengineering graduates are able to demonstrate\nthe following Student Outcomes:\n• An ability to identify, formulate, and solve\ncomplex engineering problems by applying\nprinciples of engineering, science, and mathematics.\n• An ability to apply engineering design to\nproduce solutions that meet specified needs with\nconsideration of public health, safety, and welfare,\nas well as global, cultural, social, environmental,\nand economic factors.\n• An ability to communicate effectively with a\nrange of audiences.\n• An ability to recognize ethical and professional\nresponsibilities in engineering situations and\nmake informed judgments, which must consider\nthe impact of engineering solutions in global,\neconomic, environmental, and societal contexts.\n• An ability to function effectively on a team\nwhose members together provide leadership, create\na collaborative and inclusive environment, establish\ngoals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.\n• An ability to develop and conduct appropriate\nexperimentation, analyze and interpret data, and\nuse engineering judgment to draw conclusions.\n• An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as\nneeded, using appropriate learning strategies.\nSee https://voiland.wsu.edu/undergraduate/be/.\nComputer Requirement\nAll Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering\nstudents are required to purchase laptop\ncomputers. Computer requirements are described at\nhttps://voiland.wsu.edu/undergraduate/computer-\nrequirement/.\nTransfer Students\nStudents who are planning to transfer to Chemical\nEngineering or Bioengineering at Washington\nState University from other institutions should\ncoordinate their programs with the school to\nestablish a schedule of studies leading to the\nbachelor’s degree. This is desirable because of\nsophomore professional requirements and course\nsequences. A strong preparation in chemistry,\nmathematics (through differential equations), and\nphysics is necessary prior to transfer to minimize\nthe time required at Washington State University to\ncomplete bachelor’s degree requirements. Inquiries\nconcerning specific questions are welcomed.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nAs preparation for work toward an advanced\ndegree in Chemical Engineering, a student should\nhave completed the equivalent of the following\nchemical engineering schedule of studies. A Bachelor\nof Science degree in Chemical Engineering from\nan institution with an ABET accredited program\nnormally will satisfy this requirement.\nStudents seeking advanced training in\nbioengineering should use the Engineering Science\ndegree program. Such students should have\ncompleted the equivalent of the bioengineering\nprogram outlined above. A Bachelor of Science\ndegree from any ABET accredited engineering\nprogram would normally satisfy this requirement.\nSpecial programs are also available for students\nwith bachelor’s degrees in chemistry, biology, or\nother areas of science who wish to obtain advanced\ndegrees.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nBIOENGINEERING - GENERAL OPTION\n(120 HOURS)\nStudents who plan to pursue pre-med studies should\nconsult their advisor for further information about\nappropriate courses.\nAdmission to the Major Criteria –\nBioengineering Program\nIncoming first-year students, transfer students,\nand students changing from a different major may\nbe admitted to the Bioengineering degree program\nupon completion of MATH 171 with a C or better or\nconcurrent enrollment, and CHEM 105 with a C or\nbetter or concurrent enrollment. To remain in the\nmajor the student must earn a grade of C or better\nin all courses and maintain good academic standing\n(i.e. a 2.0 or higher GPA each term and an overall\ncumulative GPA of 2.0 at WSU).\nStudents who are deficient under the University’s\nAcademic Regulations 38 and 39 or whose GPA in\nBioengineering courses falls below 2.0 are subject to\nloss of eligibility of the major.

Everything we are or do depends in one\nway or another on chemistry. A major in chemistry\nprepares you for a variety of careers in industry,\neducation, and public service, or for graduate study\nand research in chemistry and many related fields.\nThe department has excellent facilities and special\nequipment for study and research at both the\nundergraduate and graduate level. There are active\n\n116\nChemistry\nWashington State University, 2021\nresearch programs in both traditional and emerging\nareas of chemistry. For example, the department\nis an integral partner in The PNNL-WSU Nuclear\nScience and Technology Institute, with participating\nfaculty from nearly all research areas noted below.\nStudents in chemistry at WSU are encouraged to\ntake advantage of its excellent facilities and faculty\nby beginning research projects as early as possible.\nResearch expands experience beyond the classroom\ninto the realm of new knowledge.\nTypical areas for research include:\n• Analytical chemistry research spans fundamental\ndevelopments in instrumentation, synthetic\nmethodologies, molecular recognition and other\nstrategies used in separations science. These\nmethodologies are frequently used by our faculty\nto understand the migration of species through\nbiological and environmental systems.\n• Inorganic chemistry has as its center the study\nof the vast majority of the known elements\nand especially the transition metals; it includes\ndevelopment of catalysts for organic and inorganic\ntransformations and investigation of the properties\nof organometallic compounds, investigation of\nthe bioinorganic of metal containing proteins\nand radiopharmaceuticals, as well as inorganic\nradiochemical research on separation methods for\nlanthanides and actinides.\n• Materials chemistry brings the knowledge and\nunderstanding of chemistry to the study of the\nstructure and properties of materials. It involves\nthe study of chemical reactions and physical\nprocesses occurring at surfaces and in solids by both\nexperimental and theoretical means. It includes\nimportant phenomena such as energy transfer in\nlight absorbing and emitting materials, electrical\nand heat transport in solids, and extends to the\nsynthesis of new and improved materials, including\nnanomaterials.\n• Organic chemistry deals with the many\ncompounds of carbon and how these compounds\ninteract in biological systems. It includes the\nstudy of medicinal, bioorganic, mechanistic, and\nsynthetic chemistry and how these areas may\nbe used in areas such elucidation of metabolic\npathways, drug development in the treatment of\ndiseases, and environmentally benign synthesis of\nimportant chemicals.\n• Physical chemistry applies the methods and\ntheories of physics to the study of chemical,\nbiological, and nanoscale materials. It involves\ntheoretical studies of chemical bonding using\nadvanced computational methods and the\ninvestigation of the structures of solids and surfaces\nby a variety of instrumental methods including\nphoton spectroscopies, X-ray techniques, and\nsurface characterization. It also expands our\nunderstanding of molecular scale mechanisms\nfor kinetically and thermodynamically driven\nprocesses.\nDegrees and Options\nThe Department of Chemistry is on the approved\nlist of the American Chemical Society and offers\ncourses of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of\nScience in Chemistry, with options in professional\nchemistry or materials chemistry. Both of these\noptions lead to a degree for which students will\nbe well prepared for entry into the workforce\nor to pursue a graduate degree. The department\nalso offers a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry with a\nstandard option and a teacher preparation option.\nIn addition, graduate study programs leading to\nthe Master of Science in Chemistry and Doctor of\nPhilosophy (Chemistry) are also offered.\nAfter the beginning of the freshman year, a student\ninterested in majoring in chemistry should consult\nwith chemistry advisors to arrange a schedule\nwhich will permit completion of required courses\nin proper sequence. Regardless of which degree or\noption is chosen, a grade of C or better is required\nin all chemistry courses to fulfill requirements for\nthe chemistry degree.\nA student beginning undergraduate work will\nbegin with CHEM 105. Students without high\nschool chemistry will begin their study with CHEM\n103 prior to taking CHEM 105. Additionally, if a\nstudent has completed one year of Advanced\nPlacement high school chemistry and has scored 5\non the Advanced Placement Exam, credit is granted\nfor the CHEM 105 / 106 sequence. If a student has\ncompleted one year of advanced placement high\nschool chemistry and has scored 3 or 4 on the\nAdvanced Placement Exam, credit is granted for\nCHEM 105. Students who complete an International\nBaccalaureate program with a high level pass and\na grade of 4 or more on the exam are given credit\nfor CHEM 101.\nThe Department of Chemistry provides major\nparts of the course work leading to degrees in\nthe School of Molecular Biosciences. Students\nwhose interests span chemistry and biology or\nchemistry and physics should see the section on\nthe appropriate program in this catalog.\nLab Fees\nCharges for expendable laboratory supplies and\ncomputing are made in each laboratory course.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents graduating from the Chemistry\nDepartment will be able to demonstrate:\n• A thorough knowledge of the basic principles\nof chemistry, including atomic and molecular\nstructure, chemical dynamics and the chemical and\nphysical properties of substances.\n• A thorough knowledge of the subfields of\nchemistry, including analytical, inorganic, organic,\nbiochemistry, and physical chemistry.\n• The ability to read, critically evaluate and\ninterpret numerical, chemical and general scientific\ninformation.\n• The ability to communicate effectively about\nchemistry both verbally and in writing.\n• The ability to design experiments and to use\nappropriate experimental apparatus effectively.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nBACHELOR OF ARTS IN CHEMISTRY -\nSECONDARY EDUCATION OPTION\n(131 HOURS)\nAdmission to the Major Requirements\nA student may be admitted as a Chemistry major\nupon declaring their intent to the department.\nTo maintain good standing in the major, students\nmust complete CHEM 105 and 106 (or 116) and\nMATH 171, each with a grade of C or better, by the\ntime they earn 30 credits. Students must also have a\ngrade of C or better in all Chemistry courses.

Civil engineers are responsible\nnot only for creating the facilities required by\na modern civilization, but also are committed\nto the conservation and preservation of the\nenvironment. Examples of these facilities include\nbridges, highways, buildings, airports, flood control\nstructures, purification plants for drinking water,\nwaste treatment and disposal facilities, offshore\nstructures, tunnels, irrigation systems, space\nsatellites, and launching facilities.\nThe program leading to the Bachelor of Science\ndegree in Civil Engineering (BSCE) is accredited\nby the Engineering Accreditation Commission\nof ABET, www.abet.org, which is the nonprofit,\nnon-governmental organization that accredits\ncollege and university programs in the disciplines\nof applied science, computing, engineering, and\nengineering technology.\nThe mission of the BSCE program of the\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental\nEngineering is to provide a premier undergraduate\neducation in civil engineering that prepares our\ngraduates to contribute effectively to the profession\nand society, for advanced study, and for life-long\nlearning; to conduct world-class disciplinary and\ninterdisciplinary research that is integrated with\nboth graduate and undergraduate education in\nselected areas of excellence; and to serve a diverse\nconstituency through technology transfer, public\nservice, and outreach.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nThe learning outcomes of the civil engineering\nundergraduate program are the following:\n• An ability to identify, formulate and solve\ncomplex engineering problems by applying\nprinciples of engineering, science, and mathematics.\n• An ability to apply engineering design to\nproduce solutions that meet specified needs with\nconsideration of public health, safety, and welfare,\nas well as global, cultural, social, environmental,\nand economic factors.\n• An ability to communicate effectively with a\nrange of audiences.\n• An ability to recognize ethical and professional\nresponsibilities in engineering situations and\nmake informed judgments, which must consider\nthe impact of engineering solutions in global,\neconomic, environmental, and societal contexts.\n• An ability to function effectively on a team\nwhose members together provide leadership, create\na collaborative and inclusive environment, establish\ngoals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.\n• An ability to develop and conduct appropriate\nexperimentation, analyze and interpret data, and\nuse engineering judgment to draw conclusions.\n• An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as\nneeded, using appropriate learning strategies.\nThe objectives for graduates of our BSCE program\nare as follows: 1) that they engage in entry-level\nengineering or related employment or advanced\neducation; 2) that they demonstrate competence\nand ongoing development in their technical\nand professional skills; 3) that they demonstrate\ncontinued growth in effective communication;\n4) that they pursue their careers with integrity,\nservice, and professionalism; and 5) that they\ncontinue learning and they grow into positions of\nresponsibility.\nCourses can be selected to provide in-depth\nstudies in environmental, infrastructure, water\nresource, and structural engineering.\nBecause design and planning are essential in the\ncivil engineering profession, these activities are\nintroduced in early C E courses. As students advance,\nthey face open-ended assignments with alternative\nsolutions, feasibility studies, safety considerations,\neconomics, social and environmental impacts, and\nother concerns that test their creative ability. All\nstudents complete a senior capstone design class\nin which much of earlier course work is applied.\nAll seniors are encouraged to take the\nFundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam prior to\ngraduation. Two purposes of this exam are: (1) It is\na required step in becoming a licensed professional\nengineer; and (2) It serves as an assessment tool for\nmeeting the department’s objectives.\nBecause of the ever-increasing knowledge\nrequired to practice at high levels of competence\nin the specialized branches of civil engineering, an\neducational preparation of five or more years of\ncollege study is becoming more important. By an\nappropriate choice of electives the undergraduate\ncurriculum may be integrated with a graduate\nprogram to provide a continuous schedule of studies\nleading to both the bachelor’s and master’s degrees.\nThe department offers courses of study leading\nto the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Civil\nEngineering, Master of Science in Civil Engineering,\nMaster of Science in Environmental Engineering,\nand Doctor of Philosophy (Civil Engineering). The\ndepartment also participates in interdepartmental\nprograms leading to the degrees of Master of Science\nin Environmental Science, and Master of Regional\nPlanning.\nCONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING\nConstruction engineering focuses on the design\nand construction processes required to produce\nfacilities and systems that are essential to modern\nlife and infrastructure. The program leading to\nthe Bachelor of Science degree in Construction\nEngineering (BSConE) gives its graduates thorough\ntraining in fundamental engineering principles\nalong with the practical business and management\nconcepts necessary for construction professionals.\nThe program covers many aspects of the built\nenvironment such as bridges, roads, harbors,\nairports, industrial facilities, and many others.\nThe mission of the BSConE program of the\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nis to provide a premier undergraduate education\nin construction engineering that prepares our\ngraduates to contribute effectively to the profession\nand society, for advanced study, and for life-long\nlearning; to conduct world-class disciplinary and\ninterdisciplinary research that is integrated with\nboth graduate and undergraduate education in\nselected areas of excellence; and to serve a diverse\nconstituency through technology transfer, public\nservice, and outreach.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nThe learning outcomes of the construction\nengineering undergraduate program are the\nfollowing:\n• An ability to identify, formulate and solve\ncomplex engineering problems by applying\nprinciples of engineering, science, and mathematics.\n• An ability to apply engineering design to\nproduce solutions that meet specified needs with\nconsideration of public health, safety, and welfare,\nas well as global, cultural, social, environmental,\nand economic factors.\n• An ability to communicate effectively with a\nrange of audiences.\n• An ability to recognize ethical and professional\nresponsibilities in engineering situations and\nmake informed judgments, which must consider\nthe impact of engineering solutions in global,\neconomic, environmental, and societal contexts.\n• An ability to function effectively on a team\nwhose members together provide leadership, create\na collaborative and inclusive environment, establish\ngoals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.\n• An ability to develop and conduct appropriate\nexperimentation, analyze and interpret data, and\nuse engineering judgment to draw conclusions.\n• An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as\nneeded, using appropriate learning strategies\nThe objectives for graduates of our BSConE program\nare as follows: 1) that they engage in entry-level\nconstruction, engineering, or related employment\nor advanced education; 2) that they demonstrate\ncompetence and ongoing development in their\ntechnical and professional skills; 3) that they\ndemonstrate continued growth in effective\ncommunication; 4) that they pursue their careers\nwith integrity, service, and professionalism; and\n5) that they continue learning as they grow into\npositional of managerial responsibility.\nCourses can be selected to provide specialization\ntracks in environmental facilities, foundations/\nheavy civil, general civil, infrastructure/pavement,\nand structures. All students complete a senior\ncapstone design class in which much of earlier\ncourse work is applied. All seniors are encouraged\nto take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam\nprior to graduation since this a required step in\nbecoming a licensed professional engineer.\nThe department offers a course of study leading to\nthe degree of Bachelor of Science in Construction\nEngineering (BSConE).\nComputer Requirement\nAll incoming Civil and Environmental Engineering\nand Construction Engineering students are required\nto purchase laptop computers. Please contact the\ndepartment for details and specifications and/or\nvisit: http://www.ce.wsu.edu/laptop_requirements.\nhtm.\nTransfer Students\nStudents who are planning to transfer to civil\nor construction engineering at Washington\nState University from other institutions should\ncoordinate their program with the department\nchairperson to establish an integrated program\nleading to the bachelor’s degree. Inquiries\nconcerning specific questions are welcome. A\nstrong preparation in mathematics and physics is\nnecessary prior to transfer to minimize the time\n\n122\nCivil and Environmental Engineering\nWashington State University, 2021\nrequired to complete the degree requirements.

Broadly\nspeaking, the curriculum emphasizes practical\nand applied experiential learning, draws from\ncourses across campus, and provides students\nwith opportunities to think critically and integrate\n\n151\nDesign and Construction\nWashington State University, 2021\ndiverse bodies of knowledge. The professional\ncourse of study is divided into two segments: pre-\nlandscape architecture and the second – fourth year\nprofessional landscape architecture program (BLA).\nCompletion of the program leads to the degree of\nBachelor of Landscape Architecture and allows\nthe graduate to enter the profession. At least three\nadditional years of professional experience and\nsuccessful completion of the landscape architectural\nlicense examination (LARE) are necessary for\nregistration as a licensed landscape architect in\nmost states.\nThe core component of the landscape architecture\ncurriculum is the studio experience. The studios are\nstructured to facilitate understanding of the web\nof relationships among physical, biological, and\nsocial systems. Through the studio curriculum\nstudents learn habits of linking ecological processes\nwith space making and necessarily consider\ninterdependence, reciprocity, and change.\nFirst year projects focus on the basic elements\nand principles of design and design process. The\nsecond year emphasizes the concept of site and the\nmethods for and consequences of manipulating\nthe ground and vegetation. Coursework includes\nsite design, site engineering, plant materials, and\ndesign history. The third year reinforces and extends\nstudents’ understanding of the field of landscape\narchitecture and emphasizes integration of theory,\npractice, and construction. Studios focus on design\nfor communities in the broadest sense. In the fourth\nyear, coursework emphasizes design in the context\nof landscape complexity, systems thinking, and\nthe overlap of global and local issues. Students\ndevelop and execute independent projects. In the\nprojects they are encouraged to think of design\nas an answer to a question and regard their work\nas an opportunity to develop, test, and challenge\nwhat they have learned in the first three years of\ntheir design education. Computer visualization and\nfreehand drawing skills are threaded throughout\nthe curriculum.\nIn addition to travel experiences throughout the\ncurriculum, all fourth-year students must present\ntheir capstone project and a portfolio of creative\nwork at an off-campus review to graduate.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nThe program has identified four themes that include\n12 critical student learning outcomes (SLO) essential\nfor students to achieve the LA program goals. The\noutcomes are multifaceted and interrelated.\nTheme One: Define and refine design\nproblems and questions\nUpon successful completion of the BLA at WSU,\nstudents will be able to\n• Identify and characterize the complex nature of\nproblems and questions associated with human/\nlandscape interactions across a broad range of scales\n• Articulate an understanding of identified\nproblems and questions within the theoretical and\nhistorical context of the profession of landscape\narchitecture\nTheme Two: Discover and determine\nappropriate design processes\nUpon successful completion of the BLA at WSU,\nstudents will be able to\n• Identify appropriate methods of design inquiry\nand problem solving processes to produce creative\nsolutions to identified problems and questions\n• Identify, collect, and analyze necessary\ninformation using appropriate technologies and\nanalytical techniques as they relate to the identified\nproblem or question.\n• Explore and critically analyze alternative design\nor planning solutions to the identified problem or\nquestion\n• Engage in assessment and evaluation practices\nthroughout the entire design process\nTheme Three: Explore and develop\ncommunication skills\nUpon successful completion of the BLA at WSU,\nstudents will be able to\n• Justify and defend the proposed design or\nplanning solution within the context of aesthetic,\nsocial, political, economic, and environmental\nconditions.\n• Communicate the entire problem solving process\nor method of inquiry in written, oral, and graphic\nways using appropriate media\nTheme Four: Cultivate awareness of\nprofessional practices\nUpon successful completion of the BLA at WSU,\nstudents will be able to\n• Understand multiple aspects of practice\n• Show a capacity for collaboration\n• Integrate and apply diverse perspectives to design\nsolutions\n• Possess knowledge and understanding about\nallied fields and the value of interdisciplinary design\nTransfer Students\nTransfer students who have completed the\nequivalent of the pre-LA curriculum may apply to\nthe professional program by submitting a portfolio\nand academic transcripts.

Graduate degrees offered\ninclude the Master of Science in Applied Economics,\nDoctor of Philosophy in Economics, and Doctor of\nPhilosophy in Agricultural Economics.\nThe School also advises the Bachelor of Science in\nAgricultural and Food Systems, the Agricultural and\nFood Business Economics major.\nUndergraduate Program\nThe course of study for the Bachelor of Science\nin Economic Sciences is sufficiently broad to\naccommodate students with a variety of interests\nand career goals. It provides training for students\ninterested in business, law, finance, agricultural\nmarkets, environmental policy and natural\nresources, and economic development. The\nprogram also gives students the preparation needed\nfor graduate study in business, law, agricultural\neconomics, finance, and general economics. The\nprogram provides students the flexibility to choose\ncourses outside the School of Economic Sciences\nwhile still meeting degree requirements and allows\nstudents to pursue double majors in such fields as\nbusiness, math, or political science.\nThe degree requires a set of core courses taken\nby all School of Economic Sciences undergraduate\ns t u d e n t s . T h e s e c o u r s e s d e v e l o p a d e e p\nunderstanding of the basic principles of economics\nand the research methods needed for economic\nanalysis in any field of economic sciences. Students\nthen branch out to further apply the core tools in\none of seven option areas:\n• The agricultural economics option deals with\neconomic issues related to food and fiber supply\nand demand and the natural resource base that\nsupports agricultural production and societal needs.\nApplications to public decision making and private\ndecisions of farms, ranches, and agribusinesses are\nconsidered.\n• The business economics option trains students\nto use economic concepts and data analysis skills\nto analyze management, marketing, and finance\nproblems faced by businesses operating in a market\nsystem.\n• The international economics and development\noption provides students an understanding of how\npolicies, institutions and endowments influence\nphysical, human, and natural capital accumulation\nwhich leads to the emergence of poor and rich\ncommunities and countries.\n• The economics, policy and law option provides\nstudents with the analytical skills used in law school\nand policy-making including those relevant in tax,\nlaw, regulation, program, and policy arenas.\n• The environmental and resource economics option\ntrains students to make decisions while weighing\nthe trade-offs between protecting, restoring,\ndeveloping, and allocating natural resources.\n• The financial markets option provides students\nwith analytical and quantitative training in the\nsubstantial overlap between economics and finance.\nThe option requires coursework that focuses on the\nanalysis of financial markets.\n• The quantitative economics option provides\nstudents with the skills to understand and use more\nadvanced statistical and mathematical models,\npreparing them for careers involving data analytics\nor for advanced degrees -- such as a Master of Science\nor Ph.D. in economics, agricultural economics, or\nrelated field.\nIn all options, students combine course work in\neconomic sciences with courses outside the School\nof Economic Sciences. According to their individual\ninterests, students supplement their economic\nsciences training with elective coursework in many\nareas including agricultural sciences, business,\ncomputer science, engineering, environmental\nscience, history, mathematics, philosophy, political\nscience, and statistics.\nThe School of Economic Sciences also advises\nthe college-wide Agricultural and Food Business\nEconomics major. This major focuses on agricultural\nbusiness with an emphasis in economics. Please\nvisit http://afs.wsu.edu for more information.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nGraduates from the School of Economic Sciences\nwill evaluate and apply economic concepts and\nquantitative methods; will think critically, integrate\nconcepts, and evaluate results in performing\neconomic analyses; and will communicate\neffectively. Students will be able to apply economic\nconcepts, together with quantitative methods and\ntechnical information relating to the decision\nenvironment, to assist policy makers and target\ngroups in evaluating economic trade-offs and in\nmaking rational economic decisions. Graduates will\nalso be capable of analyzing and evaluating broad\neconomic and social problems concerning the\nallocation of individual, firm and social resources\nwithin their specific degree interest area. Students\nwill be capable of communicating the results of\neconomic analyses in a clear, compelling, and\ninformative manner.\nA wide variety of courses is available to non-\nmajors who want to take selected courses to\nsupport their programs in other departments.\nStudents from other departments may declare\na minor in economics, agribusiness economics,\nbusiness economics, environmental and resource\neconomics and management, or sustainable\ndevelopment (see below).\nThe school advises for the interdisciplinary\nsustainable development minor that addresses\nhow economic and social systems interact with\nmajor resource and environmental issues, both\ninternationally and domestically. This is an\ninterdisciplinary program with participation by the\ndepartments such as Anthropology, Architecture,\nEconomics, International Business, Political Science,\nthe School of the Environment, and Sociology. The\nprogram is built on the premise that as a society\nwe have a responsibility to ourselves and to future\ngenerations to steward resources in ways that foster\nlong-term environmental and socio-cultural health\nand economic viability for all peoples.\nTransfer Students\nStudents planning to transfer to Washington\nState University from other institutions should\ntake courses that meet the 100- and 200-level\ncourse requirements in economics, mathematics,\naccounting, English, communication, and\nUniversity Common Requirements (UCORE).\nStudents planning to transfer into economic sciences\nby the end of their sophomore year should have\nsatisfactorily completed the required introductory\neconomics, statistics, and mathematics courses if\nthey plan to complete the required work for a degree\nin two additional years.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nStudents planning to pursue graduate study in\neconomics or agricultural economics are urged to\nselect the quantitative economic option and consult\nwith a faculty member in the School of Economic\nSciences. All options, however, prepare students for\ngraduate school but are less quantitatively focused.\nStudents planning graduate study are advised to\ndevelop strong skills through courses in English\ncomposition, and additional work in statistics and\n\n163\nEconomic Sciences\nWashington State University, 2021\nmathematics.

The program of study is\nflexible and allows English majors to focus on\nparticular areas of intellectual interest, to pursue\nelectives, minors, and second majors in other\ndepartments, and to shape their academic careers\nin line with professional and personal interests.\nThe curriculum is designed for (1) students who\ndesire a broad education emphasizing language\nand literature, (2) students who wish to teach or to\nprepare for graduate studies in literature or rhetoric\nand composition, (3) students who intend to use\nthe background and skills learned in the major as\na foundation for careers in writing, editing, law,\nbusiness, or public service and public relations.\nThe curriculum provides majors the opportunity\nto complete their studies with a small discussion\nseminar, internship, or senior project in their area\nof emphasis.\nStudents who are preparing to teach English in the\npublic schools of Washington should examine the\nsummary of requirements for majors and minors\nlisted in the Department of Teaching and Learning\nin this catalog, and they should confer with the\nCollege of Education concerning the requirements\nfor certification.\nThe Department of English offers courses of study\nleading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master\nof Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy (English). The\ndepartment participates in the interdepartmental\nprogram in American Studies leading to the\ndegrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy\n(American Studies). The department also\nadministers the Program in Women’s, Gender, and\nSexuality Studies (WGSS), offering interdisciplinary\ncourses of study leading to the Bachelor of Arts\ndegree in its field. Students interested in this field\nshould consult the requirements listed under WGSS.\nStudents may also complete an English degree\nconsisting, in part, of international literature,\nphilosophy, art, architecture, and music courses\nfrom the Humanities sequence offered jointly by\nthe School of Languages, Cultures, and Race and the\n\n198\nEnglish\nWashington State University, 2021\nDepartment of English, within the Literary Studies\noption described below.\nEnglish Major Options\nSix options are offered for the English major, all\nleading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English:\nLiterary Studies is for students who desire a general\nliberal arts education emphasizing literature, critical\nthinking, and writing; and for those preparing for\ngraduate education in English or literary studies.\nEnglish is often selected as a major by students with\ndouble majors or minors in other departments.\nRhetoric and Professional Writing is for students\npreparing for careers in business, public service,\nlaw, or other professions requiring writing and\nreading skills. It is also suitable for those seeking\ncareers in higher education specializing in rhetoric\nand composition.\nTeaching is for students who need specific\ntraining in the teaching of language and literature\nat the secondary level; it is coordinated with the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning.\nCreative Writing is for students interested in\ncreative writing in various forms (poetry, fiction,\nnonfiction prose), in editing and publishing, and in\ncareers drawing on related creative and professional\nskills.\nIntegrative English Studies is for students interested\nin integrating courses from the above three options.\nLinguistics is for students interested in languages,\ntypes of linguistic structure, and theories of\nlinguistic analysis.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nA graduate in English studies is a creative and\ncritical thinker and writer. An education in English\npresents students with opportunities to:\n• Read literary and cultural texts carefully and\ncritically.\n• Produce a variety of creative and critical texts\nusing appropriate technologies that contribute to\nliterary and cultural discourses.\n• Develop abilities in critical reading, writing,\nand thinking necessary for them to communicate\nsuccessfully with other audiences both within and\noutside the University.\n• Explore the record of human experience in\nlanguage\nFor more information, please see: http://english.\nwsu.edu/undergraduate-studies.html.\nWomen’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\nWomen’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is an\ninterdisciplinary degree program offering courses\nin which students work together to explore the\nways that race, ethnicity, sexuality, social class,\nnationality, age, and ability intersect to shape\ngendered experience, injustice, and social change.\nUsing an intersectional lens, students gain expertise\nin analyzing gendered social roles and the ways in\nwhich they affect personal lives, artistic expression,\nwork, social relationships, institutional structures,\nthe production of knowledge, and national and\ninternational political and economic relations.\nWGSS offers a BA in Women’s Studies and minors\nin Queer Studies and Women’s Studies. For more\ninformation, consult the separate entry for\n“Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.”\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nStudents interested in a graduate program\nin English at Washington State University\nshould pursue preparation in English courses\ngenerally approximating one of the first three\nundergraduate programs described above. Students\nwith undergraduate majors in such subjects as\nphilosophy, foreign languages, and history may also\nbe accepted for graduate study in the department.\nStudents preparing for degrees which require a\nforeign language reading competency should begin\nstudying a qualifying language before entering\ngraduate school. See the “Language Requirements”\npage on the Department of English Graduate Studies\nWeb site for further details: https://english.wsu.\nedu/graduate-studies/.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nCREATIVE WRITING OPTION\n(120 HOURS)\nA student may be admitted to the English – Creative\nWriting Option upon making their intention\nknown to the department.\nRequirements in this option involve a minimum\nof 45 credits, approximately half in creative writing\nand related professional courses, the remainder\nin supporting literature courses approved by the\nadvisor. In addition to these requirements, students\nare urged to select UCORE courses in American and\nworld cultures, history, and society to round out the\nliberal arts education that they will bring to careers\nin creative writing, editing, publishing, and related\nfields.\nFirst Year\nFirst Term Hours\nBiological Sciences [BSCI] with lab\n1 \n4\nENGLISH 101 [WRTG] 3\nHumanities [HUM] \n2 \n3\nQuantitative Reasoning [QUAN] 3\nForeign Language, if necessary, or Elective 3 or 4\nSecond Term Hours\nArts [ARTS] 3\nENGLISH 251 3\nHISTORY 105 [ROOT] 3\nPhysical Sciences [PSCI] with lab\n1 \n4\nForeign Language, if necessary, or Elective 3 or 4\nSecond Year\nFirst Term Hours\nArts [ARTS], Humanities [HUM], or\nSocial Sciences [SSCI] 3\nENGLISH 351 or 353 3\nSocial Sciences [SSCI] 3\nElectives (literature courses recommended) 7\nSecond Term Hours\nCommunication [COMM] or Written\nCommunication [WRTG] 3\nDiversity [DIVR] 3\nENGLISH 352 3\n300-400-level Literature Elective\n3 \n3\nHumanities Electives\n2 \n3\nComplete Writing Portfolio\nThird Year\nFirst Term Hours\nENGLISH 302 [M] 3\nENGLISH 357, 402 [M], 498, OR 499 3\n300-400-level Literature Elective\n3 \n3\nElectives 6\nSecond Term Hours\nENGLISH 451 [M], 452 [M], or 453 3\nWriters of Color Course \n4 \n3\n300-400-level Electives 9\nFourth Year\nFirst Term Hours\nIntegrative Capstone [CAPS] 3\n300-400-level Creative Writing or Literature\nElective \n5 \n3\n400-level Literature Elective \n3 \n3\n300-400-level Electives 6\nComplete English Portfolio\nSecond Term Hours\nENGLISH 446 3\nENGLISH 451 [M], 452 [M], or 453 3\n300-400-level Creative Writing or Literature\nElective \n5 \n3\nElectives 3\n_______\n1 \nTo meet University and College of Arts and\nSciences requirements, students must take a [BSCI]\ncourse with lab and [PSCI] course with lab.\n2 \nHumanities Electives: At least one from HUMANITY\n101, 103, 302 [M], 303, 304, 335, 350, 410, or 450\nis required.

Tanigoshi, W. J. Turner.\nInsects and related arthropods are dominant\ncomponents in all terrestrial and most freshwater\necosystems. There are more species of insects than all\nthe other species of animals and plants combined.\nThis almost unimaginable diversity provides the\nmost fertile resource for scientific inquiry within\na number of areas of biology. Entomology at\nWashington State University is active, robust, and\ndynamic. The curriculum provides the opportunity\nto investigate the basic and applied aspects of the\nscience. Facilities and training are available for study\nin major areas of entomology including, but not\nlimited to, apiculture, behavior, integrated biological\ncontrol and sustainable pest management, ecology,\ninsect/plant interactions, population genetics,\nphysiology, taxonomy/systematics, biological\ndiversity, environmental toxicology, and medical/\nveterinary entomology. We believe that a detailed\nunderstanding of insect biology is a prerequisite\nto developing rational, effective, and sustainable\nmanagement practices.\nThe entomology curriculum provides the\nopportunity to study basic and applied aspects of\nentomology and prepares students employment\nin all aspects and levels of the science. Courses\nprovide needed training for students in agriculture,\neducation, veterinary medicine, microbiology,\npublic health, environmental sciences, and natural\nsciences.\nThe department offers courses of study leading\nto the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Biology\nwith an Entomology option https://www.catalog.\nwsu.edu/General/Academics/Info/10; Master of\nScience in Entomology, and Doctor of Philosophy\n(Entomology). Additional information can be\nobtained on the web at http://entomology.wsu.edu.\nIntegrated Pest Management\nIntegrated pest management is a multidisciplinary\nfield. The Agriculture and Food Security major\nprepares students to manage plant pests and diseases.\nStudents learn to understand the complexity of\nrelationships within agricultural ecosystems, how\nexternal factors influence these systems, and how\nto effectively manage pests and diseases without\nincurring undue risks to human or environmental\nhealth. The major is offered under Agricultural and\nFood Systems, http://afs.wsu.edu/.\nStudents electing this major will take courses\nin the Departments of Crop and Soil Sciences,\nEntomology, Horticulture, and Plant Pathology.\nStudents acquire a holistic perspective and ecological\nunderstanding of the philosophy, principles, and\npractices of pest management and are trained to\nbecome professional crop protection specialists.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nAs preparation for work toward an advanced\ndegree in entomology, a student should have\ncompleted an undergraduate major in one of the\nbiological or physical sciences, forestry, agriculture,\nor a closely related field. Potential students with\nmajors in other disciplines are considered on an\nindividual basis. Background work should include\ncourses in the biological and physical sciences,\ngenetics, ecology, entomology, and the plant and\nanimal sciences.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n(For the Master of Science and Doctor of Entomology\nDegrees)\nThe Department of Entomology offers graduate\nprograms leading to Doctoral and Master of Science\ndegrees. Upon completion of a Degree Program in\nEntomology, it is expected that graduates will be\nhave:\n• Knowledge of Entomology and Its Application\n• Exercise Critical and Creative Thinking\n• Perform Statistical Analyses and Research\nMethods\n• They will be able to begin and complete a\nresearch program by using the knowledge they have\naccrued by active field research.\nThe curriculum provides the opportunity to study\nthe basic and applied aspects of the science. Facilities\nand training are available for graduate study in major\nareas of entomology, including (but not limited to)\napiculture; behavior; integrated biological control\nand sustainable pest management; ecology; insect/\nplant interactions; medical/veterinary entomology;\npopulation genetics; physiology; systematics;\nphylogeny and genomics; biological diversity and\nenvironmental toxicology. Departmental faculty,\nadjunct faculty, and affiliate faculty may all serve\nas student advisors. Faculty are housed both on\ncampus and at Research and Extension Centers\nthroughout the state; the ability to significantly\ninteract with both on- and off-campus advisors\nand mentors offers students opportunities and\nperspectives not available in most programs.

In response, society is shifting\npriorities to address these issues and students are\nlooking for degrees that provide interdisciplinary\ntraining to tackle these emerging problems. Never\nbefore has there been such urgent need to address\ncomplex, multidimensional environmental and\nsocial problems.\nThe WSU School of the Environment strives to\ncreate synergy by marrying research, teaching, and\nextension efforts to ensure an ecologically sound,\nsocially responsible, and economically viable future\nfor communities in Washington. The School\nintegrates the geosciences (the physical context\nfor global change), ecosystem and natural resource\nsciences (the biological context), and social/\nsustainability sciences (the human context). School\nfaculty are located throughout WSU – in Pullman,\nTri-Cities, Vancouver, and the WSU research and\nextension centers.\nFaculty and students in the School are:\n• Generating fundamental knowledge about the\nEarth, environmental and ecological processes,\nnatural resources, and human-environment\ninteractions.\n• Developing solutions to state, national, and\nglobal environmental problems (e.g., sustainable\nuse of water, forests, wildlife, and other natural\nresources).\n• Providing cutting-edge interdisciplinary\nundergraduate and graduate training to the next\ngeneration of research scientists, environmental and\nnatural resource managers, environmental leaders,\npolicy makers, and global citizens.\n• Facilitating the integrated research and education\nnecessary to support the Land Grant mission to\nachieve a sustainable future.\n• Promoting the long-term conservation and\nenhancement of biological diversity and natural\nresources in an ecologically sustainable manner.\nThe WSU School of the Environment has defined\nseveral core themes to better address new and\nemerging challenges in the study of earth,\nenvironment, and ecology. These include:\n•“Water: Connecting Earth and Life,” current\nstrengths in eco-hydrology: modeling land and\nwater interactions, biophysical, chemical and\necological dynamics in freshwater ecosystems and\nwater resources in the Columbia River Basin.\n•“Global Change: Sustaining Healthy Landscapes\nand Communities,” existing strengths in\nlandscape and spatial ecology, wildlife ecology and\nconservation of biodiversity, restoring ecosystems,\nand environmental social science.\n•“Dynamic Earth,” Earth system science, with\nexisting strengths in earth system chemistry,\nplanetary evolution and deep time, and geologic\nand environmental hazards.\nSpecific information below describes courses and\nmajors under the Bachelor of Science in Earth and\nEnvironmental Sciences.\nBS in EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL\nSCIENCES\nThe School of the Environment offers a BS in Earth\nand Environmental Sciences with majors in: Earth\nSciences, Environmental and Ecosystem Sciences,\nForest Ecology and Management, and Wildlife\nEcology and Conservation Sciences. Additional\ninformation about the School can be found at:\nhttp://environment.wsu.edu/.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nGraduates of the School of the Environment\nare concerned with the diverse environmental\nchallenges confronting the future of all life on Earth.\nStudents learn to communicate and use critical\nthinking and creative problem solving to address\npressing issues confronting global ecology and\nsustainability on a dynamic and changing Earth.\nStudents apply scientific methods, quantitative and\nsymbolic reasoning, and decision-making processes\nas individuals or teams to explore complex scientific\nand environmental issues and analyze problems in\nboth the natural and social sciences. We emphasize\nrealistic experiential education (e.g., hands-on\nlabs, field trips and camps) to prepare students\nfor graduate studies or employment in the fields\nof natural resources, environmental science or\nearth sciences. Graduates achieve expertise in a\nprofessional specialty and develop the technical\nskills and a deeper understanding of the science\nand environmental management needed to succeed\nin a global society increasingly dependent on\ndeveloping a sustainable future.\nWeb Link: http://environment.wsu.edu/\noutcomes/\nEarth Sciences Major\nEarth Science is the study of the Earth, its\ncomposition, processes, structure, origin and\nevolution. Virtually every aspect of modern life is\nin some way dependent on the science of geology.\nThe geologic record provides the context for\nunderstanding episodes of past rapid global change.\nIt is also the geologist’s job to evaluate groundwater\nquality and quantity for drinking water supply,\ndiscover new reserves of energy and raw materials,\nassess geologic hazards in land-use planning and\nunravel the mechanisms of volcanism, earthquakes,\nplate tectonics and the origins of life.\nIn addition to the University Common\nRequirements (UCORE), basic science courses\nand the School of the Environment common\ncore, students majoring earth sciences complete a\nseries of 300-400-level courses designed to provide\ntraining for professional geological work as well as\npreparation for postgraduate study.\nThe School of the Environment has well-\nequipped geological laboratory facilities, including\nelectron microprobe, X-ray diffraction and\nfluorescence instruments, a laser ablation cell\nand 6 mass spectrometers for the determination\nof trace elements, isotope ratios, and organic\ncompounds. There are active research programs in\nvolcanology, geochemistry, tectonics, groundwater\nand contaminant hydrology, sedimentology,\nstratigraphy, and astrobiology.\nEarth Sciences majors are expected to graduate\nwith a complete understanding of earth, including\nits constituent materials, environments, and\nprocesses through which these materials form and\ninteract, and its physical, chemical, and biological\nevolution. Students are expected to be capable\nof examining and interpreting relations among\ngeologic materials in the field. Problem solving and\ncritical thinking will be applied in the classroom,\nlaboratory, and field, and effective communication\nskills will be expected. Students will demonstrate\nquantitative understanding of earth materials and\nprocesses.\nThe Geology Club is open to all students\ninterested in geology and allied sciences. It provides\nadditional opportunities for our students to learn\nabout local and regional geology. Weekend field\nand mineral collecting trips take advantage of the\nvery diverse geology of the inland northwest region,\nand provides other out-of-class opportunities for\nstudents to informally interact with each other,\nfaculty and professionals outside of WSU.\nAs preparation for work toward an advanced\ndegree in geology, a student should have completed,\nor plan to take without graduate credit, the following\nor their equivalents: SOE 102, 207, 210, 315, 320,\n340, 350, 356; one year of general physics; one\nyear of general inorganic chemistry; mathematics\nthrough two semesters of calculus. A minimum GPA\nof 3.0 is normally required for admission.\nEnvironmental and Ecosystem Sciences\nMajor\nThe Environmental and Ecosystem Sciences\nmajor is offered for students interested in\nbiological, physical, or socioeconomic aspects of\nenvironmental and natural sciences. This is the\nmost flexible of our majors, offering exceptional\nopportunities for tailoring of courses to match\nindividual student interests and needs within the\nrealm of environmental and ecosystem sciences.\nEnvironmental and Ecosystem Sciences is\nconcerned with natural and managed environments\nand their interactions with biological and human\nsystems. Emphasis is put on the comprehensive\nunderstanding of environmental and ecological\ncontexts, assessment of beneficial and disruptive\nanthropogenic impacts, and methodologies to\nanalyze and resolve conflict in complex systems.\nStudents acquire interdisciplinary perspectives\nand understanding necessary to prepare them\nfor a variety of roles in the study, planning and\nmanagement of the environment.\nAll students in Environmental and Ecosystem\nSciences major will receive a well-rounded, general\nscience background in the physical and life sciences.\nThey will develop an in-depth, interdisciplinary\nexpertise in an area of concentration within the\nfield. In addition to the University Common\nRequirements (UCORE), basic science courses and\na common core taken by all students completing a\nBS in Earth and Environmental Sciences, students\nselect a structured set of courses in concert with\ntheir advisor based upon their area(s) of primary\ninterest. Lists of approved electives are available\nfrom an advisor.\nThe School of the Environment has well-equipped\nlaboratory facilities for physical, chemical, and\nbiological assessment of aquatic ecosystems (streams\nand lakes), modeling environmental processes,\nand evaluating impacts of human activities. There\nare active research programs examining effects of\ninvasive species, ecosystem restoration, and many\naspects of water resource management.\nThe Environmental Science Club provides\nopportunities for students with common interests\nto share ideas and discuss relevant topics concerning\nenvironmental issues. The club contributes to\nsustainability programs at WSU and helps promote\nenvironmentally conscious activities on and around\n\n209\nEnvironment\nWashington State University, 2021\nthe WSU campus. In addition, it provides out of class\nopportunities for students to interact with faculty\nand other professionals. These interactions create\nopportunities for networking that helps students\nfind summer and permanent employment as well\nas internship opportunities in their chosen field.\nForest Ecology and Management Major\nThe Forest Ecology and Management major is\ndesigned to provide students the educational basis\nfor successfully pursuing a professional career\nin forestry. Each forestry student, in addition to\ncompleting the university UCORE requirements,\nbasic science requirements, the School of the\nEnvironment environmental common core\ntakes a block of forestry classes in such areas as\nforest measurements, sampling, remote sensing,\ngeographic information systems, plant ecology\nand silviculture. In addition, students completing\nthe basic requirements of this degree also have the\noption to select a limited number of professional\nelectives to further focus their basic skill set. For\nexample, by selecting the correct courses students\nmay easily complete a minor in geospatial analysis.\nStudents completing this degree also meet the\nqualifications required in U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement for forester.\nThe student chapter of the Society of American\nForesters (Forestry Club) provides out of class\nopportunities for students to interact with each\nother socially and professionally, with the faculty\nand other professionals in the region. Students\nregularly work on forestry related projects for\nlandowners in the area under the supervision of\nfaculty members, gaining practical field experience\nand further insights into the profession. These\nexperiences are often helpful in obtaining summer\njobs, internships and professional employment\nupon graduation.\nWildlife Ecology and Conservation Major\nThe Wildlife Ecology and Conservation major\nprovides students with a basic background in the\nsciences plus additional courses emphasizing wildlife\necology and management of wildlife habitats and\npopulations. Students are prepared to pursue a variety\nof careers focusing on wildlife biology and wildlife\nmanagement. The core requirements plus approved\nwildlife electives may allow majors to meet the US\nOffice of Personnel Management requirements for\nwildlife biologist, wildlife refuge manager, general\nbiologist, and zoologist. Through judicious use of\nelectives a student can also meet additional civil\nservice requirements for fish biologist and range\nconservationist. Wildlife students can further\nindividualize and often enhance their professional\ncredentials by minoring in another subject such as\ncriminal justice, geospatial analysis, or forestry.\nIn addition to the University Common\nRequirements (UCORE), basic science courses and\nthe School of the Environment common core,\nstudents in this major complete a core of wildlife\nclasses emphasizing wildlife ecology, management,\nnutrition, population ecology, and conservation\nbiology. Opportunities for specialization and pursuit\nof individual student interests beyond the wildlife\ncore are provided through approved electives in the\nareas of habitat ecology, aquatic ecology, animal\necology, and conservation biology. Students\nseeking to complete the key science perquisites for\nadmission to the College of Veterinary Medicine\nmay do so as a part of this major through the pre-\nvet option.\nThe student chapter of The Wildlife Society\nprovides out of class opportunities for students\nincluding lectures, field trips, hands-on learning\nwhile interacting with socially and professionally\nwith each other, faculty and other professionals.\nThese types of contacts along together with\nemploying organizations and interaction with\ncareer services on campus help students obtain\nsummer and permanent employment, as well as\ninternship and cooperative education opportunities\nin their chosen field.\nTeaching and research facilities and laboratories\non campus provide students with knowledge and\ntraining in wildlife ecology and conservation,\nincluding Bear Research Education and Conservation\nProgram, Wild Ungulate and Small Mammal\nResearch Facility, Large Carnivore Conservation Lab,\nEndangered Species Lab, Conservation Genetics and\nEnvironmental DNA Lab, Geographic Information\nSystem Lab, and the E.H.

Bawa (Vancouver), P. Christenson (Tri-Cities),\nD. DeHart, H. Higgs (Vancouver), M. Holloman, M.\nKinkel, I. Palmer, R. Safavi; Assistant Professor, J.\nHedges; Career Track Faculty, H. Meredith, D. Janssen;\nInstructors, D. Doty, A. Rocha.\nThe Fine Arts Department provides a range of\nexperiences in the visual arts. The department offers\ndiverse courses of study leading to the degrees of\nBachelor of Arts in Fine Arts (within this degree,\nthere are three options at the undergraduate\nlevel: an Art Studio option, and an Art History\noption as BA-FA degrees, and a Bachelor of Fine\nArts BFA in studio). At the graduate level there is\nthe terminal degree of Master of Fine Arts (MFA).\nThe Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts\nprograms are designed to open doors into the world\nof visual expression and intellectual development.\nIn particular, we encourage students to sample a\nvariety of art disciplines and make an informed\nchoice about their direction in art. The department\nincludes seven areas of emphasis within which to\ndevelop a program: drawing, painting, sculpture,\nprintmaking, ceramics, photography, digital media\nand interdisciplinary studies. These are supported\nby a strong art history component.\nStudents with a BA in Fine Arts - Art Studio\nOption or the BFA in Fine Arts, should have a\nbroad understanding of the visual arts with an\nunderstanding of arts-related concepts/terms\n(including subject matter, form, and content) and\nbasic studio production, a grounding in art history,\nand an awareness of contemporary trends in art and\ntheory. They should be able to articulate in visual\nform a range of approaches, from a representational\npoint of view through a more conceptual focus,\nmake critical judgments about contemporary art\nand culture, and have an acceptable command of\nverbal and written expression.\nStudents with a BA in Fine Arts - Art History\nOption are given broad exposure to the history\nof the visual arts. As an interdisciplinary field, art\nhistory is an intellectual arena in which students\ndevelop their perceptual skills and analytical tools to\nengage diverse art forms from multiple perspectives.\nStudents begin with foundation survey courses,\nthe History of World Art (FA 201 and FA 202), and\nthen take upper-division courses to consider art\nfrom specific cultures and historical time periods.\nIn these courses, students gain familiarity with\ncontextual issues concerning the production and\nconsumption of art. They develop research and\nwriting skills necessary to think critically about art\nand visual culture. Students are also introduced to\nbasic aspects of studio production to enhance their\nvisual skills and knowledge of material practices.\nStudents complete their studies by writing a thesis\npaper and developing knowledge of one foreign\nlanguage.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudents with a BFA should have a working\nknowledge of the processes and media that produce\n\n218\nFine Arts\nWashington State University, 2021\nworks of visual art, including a clear understanding\nof the terms: subject matter, form, and content,\nas well as specialized technical, conceptual and\nimaginative expertise in a given field. They should\nbe able to articulate in visual form a range of\napproaches, from a representational point of view\nthrough a more conceptual focus, make critical\njudgments about contemporary art and culture,\nand have an acceptable command of verbal and\nwritten expression.\nAdmission Process\nProspective applicants for admission to the\nmajor are responsible for acquainting themselves\nwith all requirements and procedures. Details\nincluding specific course requirements and portfolio\nsubmission are available in the departmental office\nor at finearts.wsu.edu.\nTransfer Credits\nThe Department of Fine Arts will accept up to 18\ncredit hours in art toward the major and 9 credit\nhours in art toward the minor.\nExchange Program\nThe Department of Fine Arts has a tuition-free\nexchange for four students with the School of\nFine Arts at Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan. All art\nmajors at WSU are eligible for this one-year study\nin Japan. Selection is made in the winter. Other\nopportunities for undergraduate study abroad in\nEurope, Australia, and the Far East are available from\nthe Office of International Programs.\nGraduate Study\nThe MFA program at Washington State University\nis a three-year interdisciplinary program where\nstudents may focus in, but are not limited to,\nceramics, drawing, digital media, painting,\nphotography, printmaking, and sculpture.\nEmphasis is placed on personal and conceptual\nartistic development in light of contemporary art\npractices. Graduates meet with faculty for one-on-\none studio discussions. The program culminates\nin a thesis exhibition held in the Jordan Schnitzer\nMuseum of Art WSU. A final oral examination and\na thesis document are also required. The degree\nrequires 57 graded credit hours and 5 credit hours\nof thesis work (FINE ART 700) totaling 62 credits.\nThe MFA Handbook is viewable at finearts.wsu.edu.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nBACHELOR OF ARTS IN FINE ARTS - ART\nHISTORY OPTION\n(120 HOURS)\nA student may be admitted to the Bachelor of Arts\nFine Arts – Art History Option upon completing\nFINE ART 102 or 103 and 9 credits of 200-300-level\nart history courses, while maintaining a minimum\ncumulative GPA of 2.0 in FINE ART courses.\nFor the Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts a total of\nat least 48 credits of FINE ART with a minimum\ncumulative GPA of 2.0 is required;

Younce; UI Affiliates: Professors,\nC. Bohach, S. Minnich, G. Moller, D. Ryu; Associate\nProfessors, B. Smith, G. Unlu; Assistant Professor, C.\nCantley.\nThe School of Food Science (SFS) works closely\nwith the University of Idaho (UI) to offer courses\nof study in the undergraduate major field of food\nscience. Some traveling to the UI campus will\noccur usually starting the junior year. Students\ncomplete a prescribed course of study leading to the\nBachelor of Science in Food Science with an option\nin general science emphasizing areas in processing\nand engineering, food sensory, food safety,\nhospitality and business management, business,\nscience, enology, or an option in fermentation\nscience. Graduate degrees are also offered leading\nto Master of Science in Food Science and a Doctor\nof Philosophy in Food Science.\nFood Science\nFood Science is the scientific discipline that\nsupports the food and beverage manufacturing\nindustry. Food Science is a multidisciplinary science\nthat applies biology, chemistry, engineering,\nmicrobiology, nutrition, physics, and other sciences\nto improve the safety and quality of food products;\ncreate healthy food products; and design new, safer,\nand more sustainable food preservation methods.\nFood scientists strive to improve the quality and\nnutrition of foods through traditional and emerging\npreservation technologies. Food scientists conduct\nresearch to mitigate chemical and microbial risk\nfactors in foods and to understand the causes of\nfood deterioration and spoilage. Food scientists are\nemployed around the world by large and small food\nprocessing companies, food ingredient suppliers,\nfood quality assurance and testing labs, federal and\nstate governmental agencies, and academia. Food\nscientists also work with existing and emerging\ncompanies preparing organic, natural, kosher, and\nhalal food products.\nGraduates of the food science program are\nwell positioned to meet the evolving challenges,\nneeds, and opportunities of the food industry not\nonly in the Pacific Northwest, but also nationally\nand internationally. Graduates begin careers in\nfood quality assurance, food safety microbiology,\ntechnical sales, production management, product\nextension or development, regulatory affairs, or\nresearch in the food/allied industries or federal/\nstate regulatory agencies.\nFood Science students learn to convert food\ncommodities into high quality, safe and nutritious\nfood products. As part of the BS degree, students\nreceive training and learn skills relative to the\nproduction, processing, preservation, safety,\nevaluation, and distribution of foods. The food\nprocessing industry is continually challenged to\nevaluate existing foods for quality, as well as the\ndevelopment of new foods to better meet consumer\ndemands and the nutritional needs of the world.\nStudents who work at the WSU Creamery can gain\npractical processing and leadership skills in the\nstate-of-the-art creamery where world-renowned\nCougar Gold Cheese is made.\nIn the first two years of college, students enroll\nin science courses and complete most University\nCommon Requirements (UCORE). In the junior\nand senior years, the curriculum emphasizes\ncourses in food processing and engineering, food\nchemistry, food analysis, food microbiology,\nsensory evaluation, and other specialized areas such\nas the processing and manufacture of cereal and\ndairy products, and fermented foods. A student may\nbe admitted to the Food Science or Fermentation\nScience option upon making their intention known\nto the department. Contact the Food Science\nAdvisor to begin the process, food.science@wsu.edu.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nOur graduating seniors will:\n• Demonstrate a level of comprehension of Food\nScience concepts and analyses equivalent to or\ngreater than that required by the Institute of Food\nTechnologists Core Competencies Guidelines.\n• Critically evaluate and summarize a food science\nissue or problem.\n• Apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills\nto address current challenges in the food industry.\n• Communicate effectively in both written and\noral format with an audience possessing varying\ndegrees of food science knowledge.\nSee http://sfs.wsu.edu/blog/2013/08/05/student-\nlearning-outcomes-bs-food-science/.\n\n222\nFood Science\nWashington State University, 2021\nOptions in Food Science\nThe General Option emphasizes open electives\nso students can take specific classes in their area\nof interest or choose a minor to complement their\ndegree. This option prepares students to work in the\nfood industry and related industries, government\nagencies, and governmental organizations. This\ndegree is IFT accredited and provides a strong science\nbackground leading to graduate or professional\ndegrees in various fields.\nThe Fermentation Science Option is for students\ninterested in yeasts, bacteria and molds, the\nscience behind fermented beverages and foods,\nand industrial-scale applications of fermentation\ntechnologies. This option prepares students to\nwork in the food, supplement, and pharmaceutical\nsectors, as well as ciders and wineries.\nOther Opportunities\nStudents with specific interests can gain\nadditional education by taking elective courses,\nparticipating in internships with food companies,\nand/or conducting a research project with a faculty\nmember. Summer internships are available to gain\npractical hands-on training. Contact your advisor\nfor more information. Graduate programs are\nalso available that lead to the degrees of Master of\nScience and Doctor of Philosophy in Food Science.\nTransfer Students\nStudents planning to transfer to the School of\nFood Science should coordinate their programs of\nstudy with advisors to select courses applicable to\nthe degree requirements. Many of the University\nCommon Requirements (UCORE) courses and\nintroductory biology, chemistry, microbiology, and\nphysics courses can be completed at community\ncolleges. We especially recommend students take\nthe appropriate science and mathematics courses\nrequired in our first two years of study, so students\nare on track when transferring to WSU.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nStudents who identify an interest in graduate work\nare encouraged to contact the advisor no later than\nthe end of the junior year, so a course of study can be\nplanned which schedules appropriate prerequisites\nto graduate courses and an introduction to research\nprojects. Students from other science majors\nwho wish to obtain an advanced degree in food\nscience are encouraged to apply as they may be\nwell prepared for graduate studies. Students are\nrequired to take certain core courses required of food\nscience undergraduates in addition to those needed\nfor their graduate program. For more complete\ninformation on our graduate program, admission\nrequirements, and program requirements, review\nthe School of Food Science website at http://sfs.wsu.\nedu/graduate-program/. Please see faculty profiles\nat http://sfs.wsu.edu/personnel/faculty-extension-\nspecialists/ for research opportunities.\nAdmission to the graduate program is based on\nability to complete graduate-level work as evidenced\nby undergraduate transcripts; the compatibility of\nthe student’s objectives with faculty expertise and\nprogram objectives; and availability of graduate\nfaculty to act as major advisor for the applicant.\nThe School of Food Science requires GRE and\nTOEFL scores, in addition to admission materials\nrequired by the WSU Graduate School.\nThe School of Food Science welcomes inquiries\nabout our program.

The Department of Human\nDevelopment is a multidisciplinary department\ndevoted to understanding the nature of human\ndevelopment within the context of families,\nschools, and communities. Students completing\na Human Development degree are well prepared\nfor a wide range of careers working with children,\nadolescents, adults, and/or families in a variety of\nprofessional settings; many Human Development\ngraduates are also well equipped to enter graduate\nschool in a number of disciplines.\nHuman Development majors may choose to\nfocus their studies in one of seven options: Family\nand Consumer Sciences Education, Lifespan\nDevelopment, Early Childhood Education, Child/\nYouth Development, Gerontology, Family Services\nor Prevention Science. All options lead to a Bachelor\nof Arts in Human Development.\nThe Family & Consumer Sciences Education option\nis for students interested in teaching in a junior or\nsenior high school setting. Family and consumer\nsciences teachers instruct courses in foods and\nnutrition, family health, human development,\napparel and textiles, family resource management,\nfamily communication, and interior design.\nGraduates are prepared for Family and Consumer\nSciences and Career and Technical Education state\ncertification. They are also well prepared for careers\nwith agencies and organization that serve the needs\nof families in the community.\nThe Lifespan Development option is for students\nwho desire to deepen their understanding of the\nfoundations of development from childhood,\nadolescence, to adulthood. Students in this option\nwill gain psychosocial and bioecological perspectives\non the interrelationships between individuals,\nfamilies, organizations, and communities. A\nLifespan Development focus opens the doors for\nmany helping professions. Students are ready\nfor careers in public and private human service\nagencies, and local, state and federal government.\nThe Early Childhood Education option focuses\non children birth-age 5. Students gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the importance of building\nrelationships with children, observing and\ndocumenting their development and learning,\nplanning and implementing age-appropriate\ncurricula and assessing the success of the planned\ncurricula. This option prepares students to be\nearly childhood educators as they complete a 270-\nhour practicum in a high-quality, early childhood\nclassroom. While this option focuses on preparing\nfor a teaching role, students are also ready for careers\noutside of the classroom working with young\nchildren and their families.\nThe Child/Youth Development option is designed for\nstudents preparing for careers or graduate education\nfocused primarily on children and adolescents.\nExamples include careers developing programming\nfor youth (e.g., parks and recreation, after-school\nprograms, youth development programs); working\nwith youth engaged in systems of care, including\nthose who have experienced trauma (e.g. residential\ntreatment facilities, foster care systems, behavioral\nhealth or developmental services); working in the\njuvenile justice system; counseling youth and\nfamilies.\nThe Gerontology option is for students who desire\nto deepen their understanding of the foundations of\ndevelopment across the entire lifespan, particularly\nin adulthood to later life. Students in this option\nwill gain an overview of the interdisciplinary\nfield of gerontology and explore psychosocial and\nbioecological perspectives on adult development\nand aging over the life course as it affects individuals,\nfamilies, and communities and has social, political,\nand economic implications world-wide. Examples\nof careers in Gerontology include working directly\nwith older adults in a variety of settings and\nadministering programs for older adults.\nThe Human Services option is for students who seek\nto improve the quality of life for individuals, families\nand communities through direct service, advocacy\nor policy. Students will gain an understanding\nof: the foundations of human development\nincluding conditions which support or limit\noptimal functioning, family functioning and\nfamily dynamics and how those relate to human\ndevelopment across the lifespan, service delivery\nsystems, and strategies for working with diverse\nclientele. Students in this option may be interested\nin careers such as family social service programs,\nadvocacy and nonprofit work, community\neducation, and counseling support. This option\nwill also prepare students for advanced education\nin social work, counseling, and family law.\nThe Prevention Science option is designed\nfor students who are interested in taking a\ndevelopmental approach to improving public\nhealth. Specifically, the Prevention Science option\nfocuses on (a) identifying risk and protective factors\nthat shape human development throughout the\nlifespan, and (b) designing, implementing, and\nevaluating interventions, programs, and policies\nthat promote well-being for individuals, families,\nand communities. The option in Prevention Science\nis a good fit for students interested in graduate\nstudies in fields such as Prevention Science, Public\nHealth, and Community Psychology; in addition,\nthis option will prepare students for careers in fields\nsuch as community coalition coordinator, public\nhealth prevention coordinator, and residential\nyouth counselor.\nThe department also offers four certificates: early\nchildhood education, adolescence, gerontology,\nand family studies. Students completing a human\ndevelopment degree may also complete a minor or\napproved certificate of study. A minor or certificate\nof study should be selected in consultation with a\nhuman development advisor, preferably by the end\nof the third semester.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nWe expect our graduating students will\ndemonstrate: 1) an understanding of social,\nemotional, cognitive, and physical development\nacross the lifespan in the family context; 2) an\nunderstanding of how contextual systems interact\nto influence family and individual development; 3)\nthe ability to critically select, evaluate, and utilize\ninformation to understand and benefit individuals\nand families; 4) writing, listening, and speaking\nappropriate for human development related\noccupations; 5) application of human development\nknowledge and skills in professional settings.\nGraduate School Preparation\nThe human development degree provides\npreparation for graduate work leading to teaching,\nresearch, counseling, or administrative positions\nin domains such as academia, social services, and\ncounseling.\nGraduate Program\nT h e d e p a r t m e n t a l s o a d m i n i s t e r s a n\ninterdisciplinary doctoral program in Prevention\nScience. Students in the program learn to conduct\nbasic research on risk and protective factors, and\nto develop, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-\nbased programs to promote the well-being of\nchildren, youth, and their families. The program\nis offered in collaboration with the Colleges\nof Communication, Education, Medicine, and\nNursing, as well as WSU Extension. Graduates are\nprepared for careers as faculty members, program\nevaluators, research analysts, and research associates\nto work in a range of settings including universities,\nresearch institutes, social service agencies, and\nconsulting firms.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nCHILD AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT\nOPTION\n(120 HOURS)\nStudents can be admitted as a Human Development\nmajor after completing 24 credits and earning a GPA\nof at least 2.0.

Alvarez.\nThe School of Languages, Cultures, and Race\n(SLCR) cultivates deeper understandings of\nlinguistic, cultural, national, citizenship, and racial\nperspectives in a global context as explored through\nan interdisciplinary approach grounded on the\nhumanities and social sciences. Located in historic\nThompson Hall, the School stands as a bridge\nbetween the past and the future through its degrees:\nAmerican studies and culture, comparative ethnic\nstudies, foreign languages and cultures, humanities,\nand social sciences. Foreign languages have been\noffered at WSU since 1890 and Thompson remains\nthe site for one of the first dedicated language\nlearning centers in the nation (established in\n1911). The interdisciplinary degrees in Humanities\nand Social Sciences date back to 1911. At the same\ntime, the School includes the contemporary and\ntransdisciplinary envisioning of culture and race\nstudies that American Studies and Culture, and\nComparative Ethnic studies embody. Together,\nthese programs collaborate in finding innovative\nresponses to the challenges of our ever-changing\nsocieties.\nThe School fosters critical literacy, intercultural\nengagement, and the pursuit of global social\njustice through grounded, holistic engagement in\ninterdisciplinary inquiry and programs. Language\nstudies in context, the study of transnational\ncultural and race matters, and integrative approaches\nto linguistic, social, and cultural phenomena\nprovide students with the skills, experiences, and\nperspectives necessary to thrive in an increasingly\ndiverse and heterogeneous global society. The\nschool interests are centered on the following:\n• Critical analysis of culture and its products\naround the globe.\n• The effects of popular culture and media on\nsocial articulations of race and ethnicity.\n• Social and cultural production of languages.\n• Social and cultural influence of languages.\n• Intersectional and interdisciplinary scholarship\nin the humanities and the social sciences.\n• Innovative approaches in teaching and scholarly\nproduction.\nAbove all, the school encourages its constituencies\nto make a difference by learning about and\ndemonstrating a commitment to issues in our\nchanging world through undergraduate and\ngraduate education, scholarship, and outreach.\nThe School offers Bachelor of Arts degree programs\nin Comparative Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages\nand Cultures (Chinese Language and Culture,\nFrench, Japanese, and Spanish), Humanities\n(including an International Studies track with major\nconcentration areas in Latin American Area Studies,\nGermanic Area Studies, French and Francophone\nArea Studies, and European Area Studies; and\nother tracks in Linguistics, and Religious Studies),\nand Social Sciences (with an option in Personnel\nPsychology/ Human Resources, available at WSU-\nVancouver only.)

Narratives to\nbe studied address specific topics related to gender\n(representations of women, men, homosexuality,\netc.), age (representations of childhood, youth,\nthe elderly, etc.), history (representations of war,\nrevolutions, dictatorships, democratization, etc.),\nculture and society (gendered roles, race, nature,\nreligion, social classes, immigration, etc.), to\nmention a few.\nCompletion of the minor requires 18 credits\nincluding a required core (6 credits) and 12 credits of\nelectives.

The numerous service courses taught by\nthe department reflect the growing importance of\nmathematics and statistics in an increasing number\nof other disciplines.\nUndergraduate training for mathematics majors\nis provided at WSU in the following six options:\nactuarial science, applied mathematics, secondary\nmathematics teaching with certification, secondary\nmathematics teaching without certification,\ntheoretical mathematics, and statistics. The\noptions prepare students for careers related to\nthe respective fields. The mathematics major also\nprepares students for graduate study in such fields\nas business, economics, management science\nand computer science, as well as mathematics\nand statistics. Talented undergraduate majors in\n\n286\nMathematics and Statistics\nWashington State University, 2021\nmathematics are given individual and small group\ninstruction outside of class, sometimes resulting\nin research publications. A new, interdisciplinary\nundergraduate degree in data analytics is also\navailable.\nWe expect that students graduating with a\nmathematics degree will be able to: 1) use their\nmathematics and statistics skills within the context\nof a strong, fundamental general education, 2)\nuse the fundamentals of the life and physical\nsciences, 3) apply a fundamental knowledge and\npractical understanding of mathematics and\nstatistics, 4) continue learning in both traditional\nand non-traditional educational settings, and 5)\ncommunicate effectively.\nAll students who enroll in mathematics courses are\nresponsible for satisfying the prerequisite(s). With\nonly a few exceptions, WSU undergraduate students\nare required to take the WSU Math Placement\nAssessment (MPA) prior to enrolling in their first\ncollege-level mathematics course. See http://www.\nmath.wsu.edu/placement/welcome.php placement\nfor more information.\nGraduate study and specialization are offered\nby the department in both classical and modern\nareas of mathematics and statistics. A PhD student\nhas four choices: a PhD in Mathematics, PhD in\nMathematics-Applied Mathematics option, a PhD\nin Mathematics with an Education Emphasis, or a\nPhD in Statistical Science. The first involves doing\nmathematical research, the Applied Mathematics\noption focuses on applied mathematical research,\nthe Education Emphasis option involves research\non the teaching and learning of mathematics, and\nthe Statistics option involves statistical research.\nAt the masters level the department offers the\nfollowing degrees: a MS in Mathematics, MS in\nMathematics–Applied Mathematics Option, MS\nin Mathematics-Computational Finance Option,\nMS Mathematics – Teaching Option, and a MS in\nStatistics. A graduate certificate in Teaching College\nMathematics is also available.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nAs preparation for work toward an advanced\ndegree in mathematics or statistics, a student should\nhave completed the equivalent of an undergraduate\ndegree in mathematics, statistics, or a related field.\nAdequate opportunities are provided for removing\ndeficiencies through the taking of appropriate\ncourses. Students who contemplate undertaking\nstudies leading to a doctoral degree should contact\nthe Graduate Coordinator (gradinfo@math.wsu.\nedu) for advice and assistance in the development\nof their plans.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nACTUARIAL SCIENCE OPTION\n(120 HOURS)\nMathematics Major Core Requirements\nIn addition to the UCORE requirements and\nthe College of Arts and Sciences requirements,\na mathematics major is required to take 13\ncore courses and a minimum of 4 additional\n300-400-level MATH courses specified by a chosen\noption.

Floyd College of Medicine is\nWashington’s community-based medical school.\nNamed after the University’s late president, Elson\nS. Floyd, the college was created to expand medical\neducation and health care access in communities\nacross the state of Washington. Under the direction\nof Founding Dean Dr. John Tomkowiak, the College\nof Medicine aims to meet its mission to solve\nproblems in challenging health care environments\nacross the state of Washington, all with a vision\nof Washingtonians living longer, better. Through\na culture based on valuing the individual, we are\nresourceful, agile, inventive and generous in serving\nthe people of the state and beyond, to develop\nhealthier populations through research, innovation,\ninterprofessional education and patient-centered\ncare.\nThe College of Medicine administration is\nlocated on the WSU Health Sciences Campus\nin Spokane with clinical campuses in Everett,\nSpokane, Tri-Cities and Vancouver. Employing a\ncommunity-based model in which students gain\nclinical experiences in hospital and health care\nsettings near the four campus locations, the college\nemphasizes training in the kind of environments\nwhere students will ultimately settle to practice as\nhealth care professionals. All campuses foster active\nlearning environments, interdisciplinary teaching,\nresearch, outreach, and clinical services.\nThe College consists of the Departments of\nTranslational Medicine and Physiology, Community\nand Behavioral Health, Medical Education and\nClinical Sciences, Nutrition and Exercise Physiology,\nand Speech and Hearing Sciences.\nThe Department of Translational Medicine and\nPhysiology is the central hub of foundational, and\ntranslational biomedical research at the Elson S.\nFloyd College of Medicine. Our faculty represent\na diverse set of interests, ranging from the\nneuroscience of sleep to cancer. Their work extends\nfrom cell and molecular physiology to behavioral\nstudies, and they employ a full range of model\nsystem as well as human subjects. The Department\nprovides research opportunities to graduate\nstudents in participating Ph.D. programs and to\nmedical students.\nThe Department of Community and Behavioral\nHealth focuses on addressing health at the\ncommunity level through research, patient care\nand degree programs, all of which align with\nthe University’s land-grant mission and extend\nthe College of Medicine’s reach. The department\nenables the college’s research enterprise to hone\ntheir focus in these areas and emphasize their\nbehavioral health work.\nThe Department of Medical Education and\nClinical Sciences delivers the MD program, training\nmedical students to be insightful and compassionate\nphysicians. It immerses students in a variety of\nreal-world and simulated learning environments\nthat provide them with the clinical and behavioral\ncompetencies to be successful in the future practice\nof medicine. In addition to preparing students to\ncare for individual patients, it readies them to take\nthe lead in addressing community healthcare issues.\nStudents learn to recognize problems in health care\ndelivery, innovate solutions, and mobilize change\nthat improves the health of entire populations.\nThe department also delivers two professional\ncertificates, the Certificate in Healthcare Leadership\nand the Certificate in Medical Ethics.\nThe Department of Nutrition and Exercise\nPhysiology focuses on the effects of nutrition\nand physical activity on human health. The\ninterdisciplinary program combines study in human\nnutrition, exercise physiology, and biological\nsciences, along with population, social and\npsychological sciences.

The\nbiochemistry/biophysics option provides increased\nemphasis on chemistry, physics, mathematics,\nand physical biochemistry, and yields a minor in\nchemistry. The biochemistry/molecular biology\noption provides increased emphasis on molecular\nand cell biology.\nGENETICS AND CELL BIOLOGY\nGenetics and cell biology are interrelated sciences\nthat are fundamental to all fields of modern\nbiology. Undergraduates who major in genetics\nand cell biology will be well versed in aspects of\nthe rapidly emerging fields of genomics, epigenetics,\nproteomics, bioinformatics and molecular signaling.\nThe program affords students the opportunity to\nlearn from and interact with scientists whose diverse\nresearch programs include the genetics of cancer\nand development, chromosome abnormalities,\nDNA repair mechanisms, stem cell biology and the\nbiology of reproduction. Our faculty work with\na diverse group of model organisms including C.\nelegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice and rats, as\nwell as using cell culture, plants, and microbial\nexperimental systems. Graduates of the degree\nwill be prepared to work in careers that traditionally\nmay not have required science training including:\nscience communication, forensics, law enforcement,\ncommunity outreach science organizations and\nscience policy development. In addition, students\nwill be trained for positions as researchers in\nbiotechnology companies, within healthcare and\nin academic institutions. This degree also prepares\nstudents for entry into graduate programs leading\nto Master’s, Professional Science Master’s and PhD\ndegrees in a variety of disciplines including the\nbroad areas of molecular biology, molecular genetics\nand cell biology. In addition, students will also be\nwell prepared to enter the professions of medicine,\ndentistry, veterinary medicine, physician assistant,\ngenetic counseling and education.\nMICROBIOLOGY\nMicrobiology is both a basic and an applied science\nthat studies microorganisms and their activities. It is\nconcerned with their form, structure, reproduction,\nphysiology, and identification. It includes the study\nof their distribution in nature, their relationship\nto each other and to other living things, their\nbeneficial and detrimental effects on human beings,\nand the physical and chemical changes they make\nin their environment. Employment opportunities\nin industrial, government, hospital, and private\nlaboratories and agencies are excellent for qualified\ngraduates. Areas in which the unit is prepared to\ndirect research include bioremediation, molecular\ngenetics, molecular basis of cell-cell interactions\nand pathogen virulence, microbial differentiation,\ncellular immunology and the regulation of the\nimmune response.\nThe Microbiology degree program offers options\nin either molecular biology or medical technology,\nleading to the Bachelor of Science degree in\nMicrobiology.

It is accredited by the National\nAssociation of Schools of Music.\nThe School of Music at Washington State\nUniversity prepares its students to be successful,\ninnovative, and employable musicians in a 21st-\ncentury career field.\nActing as local and global ambassadors, our\nstudents and faculty embrace the WSU land-grant\nmission by promoting musical curiosity, cultural\nawareness, and critical engagement through artistic\ncreation, pedagogy, and scholarship.\n\n320\nMusic\nWashington State University, 2021\nWe serve diverse communities across the wide\nreach of the WSU institution, through a musical\npractice that is fundamental to emotional wellness,\nconstructive dialogue, and self-reflection.\nPerformance Studies in Music\nPerformance studies are offered on several levels\nto meet the needs of music majors as well as those\nof students from the general university community.\nThere are no additional fees or tuition charges\nfor the use of practice facilities. The 100-level\nperformance studies are open to any student\nwithout audition through class instruction. The\n200-level denotes group or private instruction for\nadvanced non-music majors by special permission\nof the department chair (audition required).\nIndividual instruction in performance studies is\noffered at the 300- and 400-level for music majors\nand, by special permission of the department\nchair, to advanced non-music majors who meet\nall requirements for music majors as listed below.\nAll students enrolled in 200-400-level performance\ninstruction are required to attend weekly\nconvocation (student recital), attend recitals as\nrequired, participate in at least one approved\nmusic department ensemble, and take applied\njury examinations at the end of each term. A small\ntuition charge is assessed per 200-400-level course,\nnot dependent on total credits. Students enrolled in\n300- and 400-level performance study must enroll\nin a music theory or music history course each\nsemester until music core requirements have been\ncompleted. No student will be permitted to enroll\nin 300-400-level performance studies unless these\ncriteria are met. In addition, each music major must\npass the piano proficiency exam, as a precondition\nto upper-division standing.\nPerformance studies may not be taken on a pass-\nfail basis.\nBachelor of Arts\nThis program is designed to offer a broad musical\nunderstanding within a liberal arts background.\nWe expect that our graduating students be able\nto: 1) demonstrate mastery of music theory (an\nunderstanding of organizational patterns of\nmusic and their interaction, and of musical forms\nand structures and the ability to employ this\nunderstanding in aural, verbal, and visual analyses);\n2) competently perform on an instrument of choice\n(including voice) and effectively communicate on\nthe literature for that instrument and for appropriate\nensembles, and demonstrate a basic performance\nproficiency on the piano; 3) critically evaluate the\nhistory and development of music through the\npresent time and place music in historical, cultural\nand stylistic contexts; 4) comprehend the basics of\nnon-Western music and/or jazz, and demonstrate a\nrudimentary capacity to create derivative or original\nmusic both extemporaneously and in written\nform; and 5) work independently on a variety of\nmusical problems by combining their capabilities\nin performance, analysis, composition and\nimprovisation, and history and repertory. Students\noften elect a minor in another field.\nBachelor of Music\nThis program offers majors for specialization in\nperformance, composition and music education.\nThe curriculum is designed to prepare students as\nprofessional musicians, teachers, and practitioners\nof music. We expect that our graduating students\nbe able to: 1) demonstrate mastery of music theory\n(an understanding of organizational patterns of\nmusic and their interaction, and of musical forms\nand structures and the ability to employ this\nunderstanding in aural, verbal, and visual analyses);\n2) competently perform on an instrument of choice\n(including voice) and effectively communicate on\nthe literature for that instrument and for appropriate\nensembles, and demonstrate a basic performance\nproficiency on the piano; 3) critically evaluate the\nhistory and development of music through the\npresent time and place music in historical, cultural\nand stylistic contexts; 4) comprehend the basics of\nnon-Western music and/or jazz, and demonstrate\na rudimentary capacity to create derivative or\noriginal music both extemporaneously and in\nwritten form; and 5) work independently on a\nvariety of musical problems by combining their\ncapabilities in performance, analysis, composition\nand improvisation, and history and repertory.\nMusic Performance and Composition\nThis major offers professional preparation\nin music with specialization in performance\nor composition. The curriculum is designed to\nprepare students to become professional performers\nin their respective major instrument or voice, or\nprofessional composers. Students following options\nin performance or composition are required to\npresent an acceptable senior recital in the major\nperformance medium, or compositions for\ncomposition majors. Students following options\nin performance are also required to present an\nacceptable junior recital in the major performance\nmedium. Students pursuing Performance in Jazz\nStudies are limited to specific major performance\ninstruments as stated in the degree description.\nMusic Education\nThis program offers professional preparation\nin music with specialization in music education.\nThe curriculum is designed to prepare students as\nprofessional teachers of music. Students following\nany of the music education or elective studies\noptions are required to present an acceptable senior\nhalf recital in the major performance medium.\nStudents following any of the music education\noptions must have a minimum GPA of 2.5 in all of\nthe following areas: cumulative GPA, Professional\nEducation Core with a C or better in each course,\nand academic major (and minor if any) with a C or\nbetter in each course. Students admitted as majors\nin any of the music education options must also\nbe admitted as majors in the College of Education.\nBachelor of Music in Music Education,\noption without endorsement\nThis degree provides valuable, current, and\nmarketable options for students seeking pre-\nprofessional training in music, and in music\neducation. Students in this option may opt to\napply for the MA program of study in music at WSU\nwhere they may elect to complete courses required\nfor a teaching endorsement and state certification.\nAdmission to graduate school and the School of\nMusic graduate program following completion\nof this degree is determined by application on an\nindividual basis.\nMaster of Arts in Music\nPlease consult the current WSU Graduate Study\nBulletin. For students pursuing the combined BM/\nMA with teacher certification in Music, please\nconsult the department.\nSchedule of Studies\nNormal progress in all music degree curricula\nrequires enrollment during the freshman year in\n300-level performance studies. Such enrollment\nrequires an audition which is best completed\nduring the semester (usually spring) prior to the\nstudent’s matriculating in the university. Students\nwho do not audition early must do so during the\nfirst week of classes in the term. Normal progress\nalso assumes placement in 200-level music theory.\nTheory placement tests will be administered as\npart of the performance audition. Students who do\nnot qualify for 300-level performance studies and\n200-level theory studies as freshmen will usually\nrequire more semesters and credits of performance\nstudies to complete a degree than listed in this\nschedule of studies.\nTo be admitted as a major pursuing any degree in\nmusic, students must meet the following criteria:\nCompletion of 24 credits; cumulative GPA of 2.0;\ncompletion of 10 credits with a cumulative GPA\nof 2.0 and a grade of C or better in those courses\nselected: MUS 151, 181, 182, 251, 252, 253, 254,\nand up to four credits of applied study; approval\nof the appropriate applied study area coordinator;\n[approval requires two semesters’ study as specified\nby each area: Keyboard at 300 level with grade of\nB- or better, Brass and Percussion at 300 level with\ngrade of B- or better, Woodwinds at 300 level with\ngrade of B- or better, and Voice at 200 level with\ngrade of B- or better]; completion of application\navailable from department. Students not passing\nthe upper-division exam after the second attempt\nmay not continue as music majors.\nIn addition the College of Education requires\n2.5 GPA and C or better in each course listed for\nthe major, minor and professional core, plus a 2.5\ncumulative GPA, of students advancing in any of\nthe Bachelor of Music in Music Education curricula.\nAs indicated in the requirements listed under\nthe various majors and options for the Bachelor\nof Music degree and the Bachelor of Arts degree in\nMusic, each student must satisfactorily complete all\nmusic courses with a minimum 2.5 GPA and a grade\nof C or better in each music course. Each student\nis required to pass the piano proficiency exam and\nthe junior and/or senior qualifying exam, with the\nexception of those students enrolled in the Bachelor\nof Arts degree (the B.A. degree requires completion\nof MUS 182 with a C or better). Students must also\ncomplete the UCOREs plus those for the College of\nArts and Sciences.\nStudent Learning outcomes\n• Critical, Creative and Musical Reasoning: This\nincludes learning to analyze and interpret music, to\nexpress the composer’s intention, the character of\nthe music and to convey the emotion of the work.\n• Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning: This\ninvolves taking the abstract symbols on the page\nand making musical sense of them, interpreting\nthe rhythmic and pitch elements of the music and\nmaking expressive choices based on the notation\non the page.\n• I n f o r m a t i o n L i t e r a c y : M u s i c i a n s m u s t\n\n321\nMusic\nWashington State University, 2021\nunderstand the historical and cultural aspects of\nthe music that they are performing to present a\nmusically and artistically convincing performance.\nAlso, students must become familiar with a wide\nrange of important works from the musical canon.\n• Communication: A musical performance is not\nsuccessful unless there is communication with the\naudience.\n• Diversity: To perform music of different styles\nand genres, it is essential to understand diverse\ncultures and musical views. This is related to\ninformation literacy.\n• Integration of Learning: For a musical\nperformance to be truly successful, all of these\nLearning Outcomes—creative thinking, symbolic\nreasoning, information literacy, communication\nand diversity must be integrated by the performer.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nBACHELOR OF ARTS IN MUSIC\n(120 HOURS)\nThis four-year program is designed to meet the\nneeds of students wishing a broad liberal arts\nbackground with a major in music.

Normally,\nstudents enter the program at the beginning of their\nfreshman year. However, selected students may enter\nup to the end of the sophomore year. During the four\nyears students take up to 24 credits of professional\ncourses taught by the NROTC staff officers. In\naddition to professional courses, NROTC students\nmust participate in close order drill and physical\ntraining each semester. Following graduation and\ncommissioning, new officers are offered a broad\nvariety of duty assignments including duty on\nsurface ships, nuclear submarines, cyber warfare\nengineering, naval aviation, special operations\nunits, law, ground or aviation assignments in the\nMarine Corps.\nCollege Program\nApplication for this non-scholarship program is\nmade through the Department of Naval Science.\nStudents receive their uniforms and naval science\ntextbooks at no cost. At the end of their sophomore\nyear, students are eligible to be selected for Advanced\nStanding and will begin receiving a monthly stipend\nof $350 per month, which will increase to $400 per\nmonth as seniors. College Program students may\nbe nominated by the Professor of Naval Science\nfor a two- or three-year scholarship as freshmen or\nsophomores, if their academic and military aptitude\nmarks are sufficient to warrant such nomination.\nThe program requires one training cruise during\nthe summer following the junior year to meet\ncommissioning requirements.\nScholarship Program\nNaval Science (Navy or Marine-Option)\nScholarship students’ benefits include tuition, fees,\na $750 book allowance, and a monthly stipend of up\nto $400. Application for this program is normally\nmade during the early fall of the student’s senior\nyear of high school. Initial selections are based on\ncollege entrance examination scores (SAT or ACT),\nhigh school academic performance, and extra-\ncurricular activities.\nA student on scholarship participates in at least\nthree summer training cruises of three to six weeks\nduration. During the first summer, students are\nintroduced to the Surface Warfare, Submarine,\nMarine Corps, and Aviation communities. The\nsecond and third summers are spent aboard ships\nof the Pacific or Atlantic fleets and often include\n\n332\nNaval Science\nWashington State University, 2021\ntravel to foreign ports.

It\nseeks to answer questions at the molecular, cellular,\nsystems, behavioral, cognitive, and societal levels\nthrough application of a wide array of approaches\nand techniques. Neuroscience research is critical not\nonly to improving learning and performance, but\nalso addresses some of the most vexing problems\nthat prevent good health, as well as impacts the\nvery nature on how we view ourselves as sentient\nbeings. WSU has a neuroscience faculty engaged in\nnumerous focuses with particular strengths in the\nareas of energy homeostasis, sleep, circadian biology,\naddiction, emotions and well-being, sensory\nprocesses, neuronal function, electrophysiology,\nand movement. The Program sponsors Bachelor\nof Science, Master of Science, and Doctor of\nPhilosophy degrees, in addition to minors at the\nundergraduate level.\nThe undergraduate program for majors is designed\nfor students interested in preparing for professional\nstudy in the health sciences (such as medical\ndoctor or doctor of veterinary medicine), graduate\nschool, or for those who wish to use their training\nin laboratory settings in universities, government\norganizations, or industry.\nComputational neuroscience is an option\nwithin the undergraduate neuroscience major and\nlinks the information processing features of the\nnervous system with information processing of\ncomputer systems. Accordingly, the computational\nneuroscience track supplements the neuroscience\ncore curriculum with information technology\ncourses. In this way students learn not only of the\nbrain and its information processing mechanisms,\nbut also of modern computer hardware and\nsoftware technologies. Upon completion of the\nfour-year curriculum, a BS in Neuroscience will be\nawarded. Furthermore, the program is designed to\nallow students to acquire breadth in computation\nsubjects or, alternatively, to focus on either software\nor hardware aspects of computation. Students\nchoosing to acquire breadth in computational\nsubjects will be well prepared for graduate study\nin most areas of neural and biomedical science,\nincluding bioengineering. Students choosing a\nsoftware or hardware focus may obtain a minor in\neither computer science or computer engineering.\nStudent Learning Outcomes for BS\nneuroscience majors\nKnowledge:\n• Demonstrate knowledge of, and recognize the\nrelationships between, the structure and function\nof molecules and tissues involved in neurobiological\nsystems at all levels: molecular, cellular, and\norganismal.\n• Recognize the impact that science has on culture,\nand vice versa.\nSkills:\n• Perform basic laboratory techniques used in\nneuroscience research and understand and apply\nprinciples of laboratory safety.\n• Locate and retrieve scientific information and\nread, understand, and critically evaluate primary\nliterature.\n• Prepare oral and written reports in a standard\nscientific format.\n• Apply the scientific process, including designing,\nconducting, and evaluating experiments and testing\nof hypotheses.\n• Use mathematics and statistics to evaluate\nscientific evidence and interpret graphs and tables.\nAttitudes:\n• Recognize that all areas of science are integrated\nand interconnected.\n• Appreciate scientific knowledge as something\nthat is not static, but constantly expanding through\nthe ongoing work of researchers.\n• Value ethical conduct in science.\n• Recognize that the best decision-making and\npolicies are based on evidence.\n\n333\nNeuroscience\nWashington State University, 2021\nTransfer Students\nTransfer students must satisfy the program\nrequirements for graduation. Science courses\ntaken at other institutions will be evaluated and\ncredits accepted where possible. Transfer students\nare strongly encouraged to enroll in math and\nchemistry classes at the appropriate level to meet\nthe program requirements prior ro transferring.\nInquiries should be directed to the Associate\nDirector of Undergraduate Program.\n7-Year Honors Neuroscience/Veterinary\nMedicine Degree Program\nAcademically qualified undergraduate students\nwho meet the highly selective criteria for admission\nto WSU’s Veterinary Medical Program may apply to\nthe 7-year BS/DVM degree program in neuroscience\nafter completion of one year of Honors College\ncoursework at WSU. If accepted into the program,\nthe student will work toward a bachelor of science in\nneuroscience in the first three years of the program\nand work toward the doctor of veterinary medicine\ndegree in the following four years. The first three\nyears are a combination of WSU Honors College\ncourses and regular university undergraduate courses\nthat fulfill the pre-veterinary and Neuroscience\nmajor requirements. The last four years are the\ntraditional doctor of veterinary medicine program,\nplus completion of an honors thesis. Prospective\napplicants must be admitted to the WSU Honors\nCollege and enrolled in Honors courses. See the\nHonors College for additional information.\nPreparation for Graduate Study in\nNeuroscience\nThe graduate program prepares students for\ncareers in academia, industry, and government\nservice. Students work closely with faculty members\nwho are internationally known for their research\naccomplishments in energy homeostasis, sleep,\ncircadian biology, addiction, emotions and well-\nbeing, sensory processes, neuronal function,\nelectrophysiology, and movement. Upon\ngraduation, students with a doctoral degree are\ncredible international experts in the area of their\nthesis research. They will have developed cutting\nedge technical research skills, be capable of\nindependently organizing and writing publishable\nresearch manuscripts, know the fundamentals on\nhow to write competitive research proposals, have a\nbreadth of knowledge that enables them to critically\nevaluate neuroscience research, and finally, develop\ninsights that help them identify areas ripe for future\ninvestigation. These skills are not only appropriate\nfor basic research, but the ability to organize a set\nof sophisticated goals, identify a plan to accomplish\nthose goals, and then successfully complete the plan\nare skills transferable to many jobs. Our graduates\nhave gone on to excellent positions in tier-one\nresearch universities, teaching colleges, industry\n(e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical\ndevice), as well as professional schools (e.g., medical,\nveterinary, optometry).\nTo be eligible for admission, candidates must meet\ngeneral Washington State University requirements\noutlined at the Graduate School website: http://\ngradschool.wsu.edu/ in effect at the time of\ntheir admission, as well as the current graduate\nneuroscience program requirements.\nApplicants to the Ph.D. or M.S. program are\nrequired to have a Bachelor’s degree from an\naccredited higher education institution.

During the first three years, student\npharmacists develop a foundation in biomedical\nand pharmaceutical sciences, engage in peer-to-\npeer role play and simulations of clinical scenarios,\nand eventually work with complicated patient\ncases and develop confidence in building patient\nspecific plans.\nDuring the fourth professional year, students gain\nexperience in a variety of health care environments,\nincluding community, institutional and long-term\ncare settings. The curriculum consists of 6 six-\nweek rotations of advanced experiential training,\nin which students will be assigned to one of the\nfollowing geographic locations: Spokane, Yakima,\nTri-Cities/Walla Walla, Wenatchee, Seattle/Tacoma,\nOlympia, Pullman, or northern California. Students\nhave the opportunity to preference their preferred\ngeographic locations to complete the majority of\nrotations.\nThe college offers an additional degree option,\nthe Doctor of Pharmacy with Research Honors.\nThe curriculum for this option includes additional\ncoursework: a course in responsible conduct\nof research, and research credits taken in both\nsemesters of the second and third professional years.\nInterested students may apply for admission to the\nResearch Honors program in their first professional\nyear.\nWe enroll approximately 170 students to the\nDoctor of Pharmacy program annually in the\nfall, 135 for the Spokane campus and 35 for the\nYakima PharmD Extension. The application period\neach academic year is from July to January. We\nrecommend students prepare and submit their\napplication one calendar year before they intend to\nPharmaceutical Sciences and Molecular Medicine\nWashington State University, 2021\n\n349\nbegin the pharmacy program. Although a bachelor\ndegree is not required for admission, pre-requisites\nfor admission require three years of pre-pharmacy\neducation.\nAs a college, we utilize a holistic application\nreview process. This process considers a range of\ncharacteristics beyond academic metrics such as\ngrades and test scores. While we will evaluate grades\nand prerequisite grade trends, we will also evaluate\nstudents on a case-by-case basis by reviewing letters\nof recommendation, personal statements, and\nour professional goal statements. After our initial\napplication review, you may be invited to a Doctor\nof Pharmacy interview. We encourage interviewees\nto be themselves and share stories throughout the\ninterview to help us better understand you and your\nmotivations.\nFor additional information regarding the Doctor\nof Pharmacy curriculum, please see the CPPS home\npage at https://pharmacy.wsu.edu or contact the\nCPPS Office of Student Services at 509-368-6605.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nWashington State University College of Pharmacy\nand Pharmaceutical Sciences (CPPS) PharmD\nCurriculum Outcomes are Standards 1, 2, 3, and\n4 of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy\nEducation (ACPE) Standards 2016.

Rasmussen.\nPhysics is the study of nature at its most fundamental\nlevel. It is the science upon whose principles all\nother sciences and technologies are based. A major\nin physics is ideal preparation not only for further\nstudy in physics but also for advanced study in\nbiophysics, medicine, astrophysics, geophysics,\nchemical physics, engineering, meteorology, and\ncomputer science. All of these areas also offer\npotential careers for the physics major.\nCourses offered introduce the student to the major\nphysical theories: mechanics, thermodynamics and\nstatistical physics, electricity and magnetism, and\nquantum physics. Additional undergraduate courses\ncover optics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, solid\nstate physics, biological physics, and astrophysics.\nStudents test the theories in laboratories and\nlearn experimental techniques needed to work\nwith modern apparatus such as computers, high-\nvacuum equipment, lasers, and electronic and\noptical devices.\nActive research programs supported by federal\ngrants and contracts are pursued in the following\nfields: acoustics (scattering, nonlinear processes,\nand levitation); astrophysics (planetary, stellar,\nand galactic structure and evolution); astrophysical\ngeneration of gravitational waves, gravitational\nwave data analysis, cosmology; optical properties\nof semiconductors; biophysics; nanoscale physics\nand materials, Bose-Einstein condensates, cluster\nphysics; optical physics (femtosecond laser\nspectroscopy, scattering from doped polymers,\nnonlinear optics, quantum electronics, Fourier\nspectroscopy, diffraction catastrophes); physics\neducation (use of microcomputers in teaching\nand labs); nuclear solid state physics (MÖssbauer\neffect, perturbed angular correlation, positron\nannihilation studies of defects in solids); shock wave\nand high pressure physics (chemical and structural\nresponse of condensed materials to high dynamic\npressures, time-resolved optical spectroscopy,\nshock and detonation wave propagation, chemical\nreactions, dynamic mechanical failure); surface\nand chemical physics (synchrotron SAFS, diamond\nfilms, molecular interactions with surfaces,\nreactive etching of surfaces, photoelectric and\nthermal emission microscopy); theory (quantum\nchaos, nonlinear dynamics, mesoscopic systems,\nphase transitions and critical phenomena,\nquantum liquids and gases, atomic and molecular\nphysics (ultra-cold atoms, optical pumping,\nmagnetic resonance), classical and quantum gravity,\nblack hole thermodynamics, and low-temperature\nphysics). These research groups offer graduate\nstudents the opportunity to pursue original\ninvestigations required for advanced degrees.\nUndergraduate physics majors are encouraged to\nparticipate in research through the special-project\ncourse (PHYSICS 499) and through part-time jobs\nthat are sometimes available.\nThe department offers courses of study leading to\nthe degrees of Bachelor of Science in Physics, Master\nof Science in Physics, and Doctor of Philosophy\n(Physics).\nAstronomy courses at both the undergraduate and\ngraduate levels are administered by the department.\nInstruction in astronomy is enhanced by the use\nof a 12-inch telescope at the Jewett Observatory,\nthe Spitz planetarium, and faculty research at LIGO\ngravitational-wave observatory. Opportunities are\navailable for students to collaborate with faculty to\ndo research projects.\nPharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences\nWashington State University, 2021\n\n353\nThe Department of Physics and Astronomy is a\nmajor participant in the Materials Science Program\nand offers courses and research opportunities\nleading to advanced degrees in this interdisciplinary\nprogram.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nA student who has completed the undergraduate\nprogram in physics will be able to use scientific\nreasoning to form and test hypotheses; think\nindependently and critically in acquiring,\nreproducing, and assessing information from\na variety of sources; understand the important\nconcepts in each of the four core areas of physics:\nmechanics, electricity and magnetism, modern\nand quantum physics, and thermal and statistical\nphysics; apply these concepts in mathematical\nmodels to solve theoretical and real-world problems;\ndesign and conduct scientific experiments which\ntest new ideas and theories; present concepts and\nresults clearly, both orally and in writing; and\nbe prepared for graduate study and/or careers in\nphysics and related fields.\nTransfer Students\nTransfer students receive credit for equivalent\ncourses taken elsewhere, but must meet the\nrequirements for graduation listed.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nUndergraduate students contemplating graduate\nwork in physics should consider enrolling in\nPHYSICS 443, 521, 571, and additional math\ncourses.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS OPTION\n(120 HOURS)\nThe program of courses below is appropriate\nfor students who wish to enter industry upon\ngraduation. The program of courses below is\nappropriate for students who have had a good\nexperience with calculus in high school and wish\nto start physics in the first semester at WSU (even\nthough the student may be placed in MATH 171,\nif their high school grades for the year course\nwere B or better they can follow this schedule of\nstudy).

Smith.\nPlant pathology is the study of plant diseases,\nincluding causes, economic consequences, spread,\nand control. Opportunities for graduates in plant\npathology include positions in research and\ndevelopment, teaching, extension, diagnostics, and\nsales. Plant pathologists are employed throughout\nthe world by industries, governments, educational\ninstitutions, and private foundations.\nMost opportunities in plant pathology require\nadvanced degrees. Students who intend to\nterminate university training with a baccalaureate\ndegree are encouraged to enroll in the Agricultural\nand Food Systems (Agriculture and Food Security\nmajor) or Integrated Plant Sciences curricula. For\nmore information on these baccalaureate degrees,\nplease visit https://cahnrs.wsu.edu/academics/\nmajors/.\nThe courses offered in this department are\ndesigned both to train students expecting to\nmake plant pathology their professional field\nof specialization and to provide supplementary\ntraining for students in other biological and\nagricultural fields, particularly botany, crop science,\ngenetics, horticulture, forestry, and entomology.\nStudents who expect to become professional\nplant pathologists are advised to include in their\nundergraduate studies fundamental courses in\nbotany, chemistry, genetics, microbiology, physics,\nand zoology.\nA professional career in plant pathology would\nbenefit from graduate training. Students often\nenter the graduate program in plant pathology\nfollowing a major in biology, botany, crop science,\ngenetics, horticulture, molecular biology, or similar\nareas as well as in plant pathology. Specialized\nareas of advanced study include bacteriology,\nmycology, nematology, virology, epidemiology,\nmolecular biology of host-parasite relationships,\necology of disease development, disease resistance,\nchemical control, and biological control. Research\nis conducted on diseases of grain crops, forage\ncrops, forest trees, tree fruits, grapes, vegetables,\nornamentals, and turf.\nThe department offers Master of Science in\nPlant Pathology, and Doctor of Philosophy in\nPlant Pathology and contributes to the degrees\nof Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Food\nSystems, Bachelor of Science in Integrated Plant\nSciences, and the Master of Science in Agriculture\nonline degree.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nAs preparation for work toward an advanced\ndegree, a student should have completed a\nbachelor’s degree; at least one semester each of\ngeneral inorganic chemistry, botany, zoology,\nphysics; one semester each of systematic botany,\nplant physiology, general plant pathology,\nentomology, microbiology, precalculus, organic\nchemistry, genetics, and report writing or advanced\ncomposition.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nTo enable students earning the M.S. and Ph.D.\nin Plant Pathology to understand and apply the\nscientific method to plant pathological problems,\nto develop critical thinking and professional\nskills needed for successful careers in public and\nprivate sectors, the program provides training and\ncoursework to help students develop the following\nskills:\n• Understanding, interpretation and synthesis of\nscientific literature pertaining to plant pathology\nand related disciplines\n• F o r m u l a t i n g h y p o t h e s e s ; d e v e l o p i n g\nexperimental designs to test these hypotheses;\nestablishing and maintaining experiments\n• Collecting data in an objective way and\nconducting appropriate statistical analyses\n• Interpretation and presentation of research\nresults in oral and written formats\n• Presentation of research at professional meetings\nand local commodity meetings\n• Publication of research in peer-reviewed scientific\njournals and other discipline-appropriate outlets\nsuch as commodity newsletters\nTo maintain a leadership role in plant pathology\nand related disciplines at the state, national and\ninternational levels, the program aims to:\n• Attract, retain and train high quality graduate\nstudents\n• Place students earning the M.S. into positions\nincluding extension agents, state and federal plant\npathologists, instructors at the community college\nlevel, support scientists in public or private sector\nresearch programs, and PhD programs\n• Place students earning the Ph.D. as leaders of\nscientific research programs in the public or private\nsector including industry, and faculty positions at\nthe University level.\nDescription of Courses\nPLANT PATHOLOGY\nPL P\n150 [BSCI] Molds, Mildews, Mushrooms:\nThe Fifth Kingdom 3 A survey of the socio-\nhistorical impact of fungi and their role in\ndevelopment and application of the scientific\nmethod.\n300 Diseases of Fr uit Crops 2 Course\nPrerequisite: BIOLOGY 120, HORT 310, or\nHORT 313.

This curriculum reflects\nrecommendations of the Association of American\nLaw Schools.\nGlobal Politics: This option emphasizes\ncomparative and international politics and includes\nan international experience that can be fulfilled\nthrough study abroad, an international internship,\na minor in a foreign language or global studies, or\nROTC.\nGovernment is the nation’s largest employer.\nMany public officials are political science graduates.\nThe school advises students concerning training\nand career opportunities in federal, state, and\nlocal governments, the Foreign Service, and\nrelated occupations. Its internship programs place\nstudents in public agencies, political parties, and\nsimilar organizations. The school also encourages\nand advises students on study abroad as part of\npreparing for careers in international affairs.\nPreparation for Graduate Study\nhttps://pppa.wsu.edu/graduate-studies/\nStudents with some undergraduate course work\nin political science while majoring in such subjects\nas economics, business administration, history,\ncriminal justice or sociology may readily pursue\ngraduate study in political science. Undergraduates\nat other institutions or in other programs at this\ninstitution who contemplate graduate work in this\nprogram should acquire some training in political\nscience. For graduate study and its graduate degree\nprograms, our students currently choose from one\nmajor foundational training area within which they\nwill focus for their preliminary exams (Institutions\nand Processes; Behavior and Psychology; Theory\nand Philosophy), as well as a specialization field\n(American politics; Global politics; Public Policy/\nPublic Administration).\nPHILOSOPHY PROGRAM\nhttps://pppa.wsu.edu/undergraduate-studies/b-a-in-\nphilosophy/\nThe Philosophy program in the School of Politics,\nPhilosophy, and Public Affairs offers courses in\nwhich students discuss fundamental intellectual\nquestions and both classical and contemporary\nattempts to address them. What makes for a morally\nright act or a just society? What sorts of things can\nwe really claim to know? What is mind, and what\nis its relation to matter? Are we really capable of free\nchoice or is our every act determined by past events?\nThese are the kinds of questions that are addressed\nby philosophers.\nPhilosophy students acquire knowledge of ethics,\nlogic, political philosophy, philosophy of religion,\nepistemology, metaphysics, and other areas that\nprovide excellent intellectual foundations for\ncareers in law, government service, education,\nministry, and many other fields. This is reflected in\nthe fact that philosophy majors, on average, perform\nbetter than any other major on professional and\ngraduate school admission tests that are required for\nadmission to law school, medical school, business\nadministration programs, and graduate school.\nThe study of philosophy enables students to\nexplore critically a variety of systems of beliefs and\nvalues, to identify and challenge the foundations of\ntheir own beliefs and values, and to develop critical\nthinking and communication skills that are in high\ndemand and central to success in all professions.\nThe School of Politics, Philosophy, and Public\nAffairs offers programs of study leading to the\nBachelor of Arts in Philosophy (in either the General\nOption or the Pre-Law Option) and the Graduate\nCertificate in Bioethics.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nMore specifically, the school’s programs teach\nstudents to:\n• Identify important issues, problems, and\nchallenges in the discipline and how to develop\nstrategies and solutions to solve them;\n• Recognize, construct, and evaluate arguments,\nand employ those arguments on relevant issues in\nthe discipline and more generally;\n• Use the specific methods of the discipline to\nconduct meaningful problem driven research;\n• Recognize and respond to alternative, diverse\nviewpoints, and discuss normative, theoretical, and\ndescriptive aspects of the issues, arguments, and/or\ncontexts appropriately.\nOptions within the B.A. in Philosophy:\nGeneral Option and Prelaw Option\nGeneral: The General Option provides broad\ntraining in philosophy, including an emphasis on\nthe history of philosophical thought.\nPre-Law: The Philosophy Pre-Law Option is\ndesigned to prepare students for law school and\neventual careers in law. This curriculum emphasizes\nethics, political philosophy, and critical thinking,\nand it reflects recommendations of the Association\nof American Law Schools. Students choosing\nother school options are also eligible to attend law\nschool if they meet admission requirements, but\nphilosophy is widely recognized as an excellent\nacademic preparation for law school.\nPUBLIC AFFAIRS\nhttps://cas.vancouver.wsu.edu/public-affairs\nThe Public Affairs degree is offered at the\nundergraduate level exclusively on the WSU\nVancouver Campus. The Bachelor of Arts in Public\nAffairs (BAPA) seeks to develop critical thinking\nabout political and social values and develop the\nability to conduct objective analysis of public\ninfrastructures and bureaucratic processes. The\ndegree program is designed to educate people\nfor service in public and nonprofit agencies and\nto prepare students for graduate or law school.\nIn addition to core courses, students complete\na concentration in public policy and politics,\npublic administration and management, or justice\nstudies. The program’s multidisciplinary perspective\nprovides for the blending of theory, methodology,\nand experience in an academically rigorous degree\nformat.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nStudying Public Affairs enables students to become\nethical, engaged and competent professionals, in\npublic administration, public management and\npublic policy. Graduates from our programs are\nwell prepared for careers in public service at the\nlocal, state, national or global levels, or for pursuing\nfurther studies. The program offers an intersection\nbetween rigorous academic research and practical\napplication. Our goal is to foster evidence-based\nreasoning and practice on the part of those working\nfor the public good, including students, community\nmembers, legislators, practitioners, scholars, and\nissue stakeholders.\nStudents in public affairs are expected to\ndemonstrate learned capacity in the universally\nrequired competencies of the Network of Schools of\nPublic Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA)\nas appropriate for the student’s level of study (i.e.\nundergraduate or graduate).

The\nfundamental insight of the discipline is that the\nsocial matters; our lives are affected not only by\nour personal psychology, but by our place in the\nsocial world. Substantively, sociologists look at a\nrange of issues, from inequality to human ecology,\nfrom deviance to social order, from medicine to\npolitics. Few fields offer students (and researchers)\nopportunities of such breadth.\nCourses in sociology are designed to provide\nthe student with an understanding of what makes\nIndividuals and groups behave the way they do.\nSocial inequality, social order, and social change\nare prominent themes. In today’s changing job\nmarket, the skills developed by sociology majors\nare important – skills in analyzing problems,\nunderstanding diverse peoples, and assessing\nhow changes in the broader social structure shape\nindividuals’ daily lives. Sociology also provides\ntraining in social science research methods and\nstatistics, communication, and critical thinking.\nSuccessful sociology majors enter the professional\nworld with skills useful in a wide range of careers\nincluding public relations, community planning,\npositions in government and social agencies, as\nresearchers and data analysts, criminal justice\nsystem professions, health and medical fields,\nand business. Sociology also provides an excellent\nfoundation for professions that may require\ngraduate school training, such as counseling, law,\npublic policy and administration, social work,\npublic health or teaching.\nThe department offers courses of study leading to\nthe degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Sociology, Master\nof Arts in Sociology, and Doctor of Philosophy. It\nalso offers an undergraduate minor in Sociology,\na minor in At-Risk Youth, a minor in Workplace\nDiversity, and, in partnership with the Carson\nCollege of Business, a certificate in Organizational\nLeadership in Sustainability.\nUndergraduate Student Learning\nOutcomes\nAt the completion of the bachelor of arts degree\nin sociology, students will be able to 1) think\ncritically about social problems; 2) understand\nand apply basic statistics to social issues; 3) clearly\ncommunicate sociological concepts, theories,\nand findings; 4) evaluate and conduct empirical\nresearch, and use social science to develop\ninformed judgements about significant social\nissues; 5) analyze the relationships between social,\ntechnological, and natural physical systems; 6)\nanalyze the contributions of social institutions to\nsocial order; 7) analyze the causes and consequences\nof social inequality; and 8) put into practice the\nskills and habits of successful professionals.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nSOCIOLOGY\n(120 HOURS)\nA student may be admitted to the Sociology\nprogram upon making their intentions known to\nthe department.\nThis is a prototype of one of many ways to\ncomplete the Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in four\nyears. The program has built-in flexibility.\nA Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology requires\na minimum of 31 credits of sociology coursework\nin which students must maintain a C average. All\nmajors must complete five required core courses:\nIntroduction to Sociology (SOC 101), Development\nof Social Theory (SOC 310), Research Methods in\nSociology (SOC 317 [M]), Quantitative Techniques\nin Sociology (SOC 321), and one of the following\n“capstone experience” integrative capstone courses:\nInternship Capstone (SOC 495 [CAPS][M]), From\nTheory to Practice Capstone (SOC 496 [CAPS][M]),\nor Research Practicum Capstone (SOC 497 [CAPS]\n[M]).\nStudents must also complete 15 credits of\nelective courses in sociology and 12 credits in\na concentration area, half of which must be in\n300-400-level courses.

The teaching certificate, awarded by\nthe State Superintendent of Public Instruction upon\nrecommendation by Washington State University,\ndesignates the subject area in which the certificate\nholder is qualified to teach. Candidates seeking a\nB.A. in Education must also complete 20 hours in\nan endorsable area (e.g., English Language Learning,\nSpecial Education, Middle Level Math, Middle Level\nScience, etc.). Admission to the teacher education\nprograms at all campuses is selective. Teacher\neducation is offered at the Pullman, Spokane, Tri-\nCities, and Vancouver campuses, although not all\nprograms are available at each site.\nThe teaching certificate will be awarded if the\nfollowing provisions are met:\n• The candidate provides evidence of good character\nand personal fitness to teach. Fingerprinting is\nrequired. A background investigation is conducted\nby the Washington State Patrol, the FBI, and Office\nof Professional Practices.\n• T h e d e g r e e i s a w a r d e d a n d t h e\nprofessional education program is satisfactorily\ncompleted following these guidelines:\n• All course work is taken for a letter grade where\noffered. Pass, Fail grading is not accepted except for\nfield experience courses.\n• The candidate has earned no grade lower than\nC (2.0) for professional course work, and course\nwork in the endorsements. The C minimum grade\nalso applies to general education, math, science,\nand social studies requirements in the elementary\nprogram.\n• The cumulative WSU GPA and the GPA computed\nseparately for professional course work and each\nendorsement is not less than 2.5.\n• The student has completed all work within five\nyears of admission to teacher education. Those not\nfinishing within this time limit will be subject to all\nnew program requirements.\n• The candidate has achieved a passing score\nor demonstrated basic skills on the statewide\nexaminations in basic skills (WEST-B, SAT, or ACT),\ncontent (WEST-E or NES).\n• The candidate has met the Professional\nDispositions Assessment standards.\nTransfer students entering an undergraduate\nor post-baccalaureate certificate program must\ncomplete at least fifty percent of the professional\neducation core, and, if preparing to teach at the\nelementary level, fifty percent of the elementary\nendorsement course work, plus student teaching\nat WSU. Transfer students and post-baccalaureate\napplicants should consult with an advisor regarding\nequivalency and transferability of course work.\nOpportunities are provided for teacher certificate\ncandidates to gain meaningful experiences by\nworking directly with and observing children in\nschool settings. It is WSU’s intent to place only\nthose individuals in K-12 classrooms that are able to\ndemonstrate a positive impact on student learning,\nand to insure that they possess those characteristics\ndesirable for working with children and young\npeople. The College of Education therefore reserves\nthe right to refuse placement of any student in a\nfield experience, or to terminate an individual’s\nplacement if in the professional judgment of the\nfaculty, the hosting school, or coordinating field\npersonnel there is cause for concern about the\nfitness of that individual to work with children\nin a classroom setting. The student teaching field\nplacement is arranged by the faculty with school\ndistricts contracted to provide experiences for WSU\nstudents. Students do not make their own student\nteaching placements.

Additional information, including\nrequirements for admission, is contained in the\ngeneral information section of this catalog.\nThe professional DVM program offered by the\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine at Washington\nState University is accredited by the Council on\nEducation of the American Veterinary Medical\nAssociation.\nDOCTOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE\nPROGRAM REQUIREMENTS\nA minimum of seven years is generally necessary\nto obtain the degree of Doctor of Veterinary\nMedicine (DVM). Most successful applicants have\ncompleted three to four years of undergraduate\neducation. Following undergraduate studies, a\nstudent then takes four years of professional study\ndirected by the College of Veterinary Medicine.\nApplicants for admission to the College of\nVeterinary Medicine must present at least 64\nsemester credits of acceptable prerequisite credits\nfrom an accredited college or university. The 64\nsemesters should include: 36 credits of science\nand math prerequisites, including general biology,\ninorganic and organic chemistry, biochemistry,\nphysics, mathematics, genetics, and statistics; and\n27 credits of University Common Requirements\n(UCORE): 21 credits of social science, arts and\nhumanities, history, diversity studies, language,\netc.; and 6 credits of English composition and\ncommunication (written or verbal). Non-\ncognitive criteria for admission include clinical,\nanimal, employment, volunteer, and research\nexperience, honors, awards, and scholarships,\nextracurricular activities, community service, letters\nof recommendation, personal statements, and a\npersonal interview.\nCourses designed to fit the academic requirements\nare offered by Washington State University, and\nthe number of students admitted to undergraduate\ncourses is not limited. Because the number of\napplicants for admission to the DVM program\nexceeds the number that can be admitted, no\nassurance can be given that all applicants who\nsuccessfully complete the undergraduate curriculum\nwill be admitted. WSU does not grant a BS in pre-\nveterinary medicine. Students taking pre-veterinary\ncourse work may declare a major in any subject.\nMany successful applicants major in animal science,\nbiology, chemistry, microbiology, neuroscience,\nwildlife ecology, zoology, or other science-related\nfields.\nA major in veterinary medicine is not declared\nuntil admission to the College of Veterinary\nMedicine has been granted.\nInformation regarding the acceptability of course\ncredits should be obtained from the Office of\nStudent Services, College of Veterinary Medicine.\nADMISSION TO THE DVM PROGRAM\nA student seeking to enter the professional DVM\nprogram should fill out a Veterinary Medical College\nApplication Service (VMCAS) application at http://\nwww.aavmc.org/Students-Applicants-and-Advisors/\nVeterinary-Medical-College-Application-Service.\naspx) designating WSU as a school of choice and\nanswering the supplemental questions. Please see\nhttp://dvm.vetmed.wsu.edu for further application\ninformation. The Admissions Committee selects\nthose students to be admitted to the first year of\nthe professional DVM program. Applicants will be\nnotified of their acceptance on or before April 15th.\nUnsuccessful applicants who wish to be considered\nthe next year must present new applications.\nIn accordance with policies adopted by the\nBoard of Regents, preference for admission to\nthe professional DVM program in the College of\nVeterinary Medicine is as follows:\n• To qualified applicants who are certified and\nfinanced as residents of Washington, Idaho,\nMontana, or Utah.\n• To qualified applicants certified and financed\nby the Western Interstate Commission for Higher\nEducation (WICHE) contract states\n• To all other qualified applicants\nPRE-ADMITTANCE PROGRAMS\nA highly selective program for admission of\nacademically qualified students to the DVM\nprogram at Washington State University College of\nVeterinary Medicine has been established with the\nWSU Honors College. This program conditionally\nadmits successful applicants directly to the program\nupon completion of one year of undergraduate\nwork at WSU. This is a pre-admit program leading\nto the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree after\nsatisfactory completion of a designed curriculum.\nIt consists of three years of a unique undergraduate\npre-professional education and the four-year\nprofessional DVM program. The first three years of\nthis program are a combination of Honors College\ncourses and regular University classes which fulfill\nthe pre-veterinary requirements plus the completion\nof an honors thesis. The last four years are the\ntraditional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program.\nInterested students should identify themselves to\nthe Honors College as soon as they decide to enter\nWSU, because the number of positions is limited.\nFor the Combined Program in Animal Sciences\nand Veterinary Medicine - See Department of\nAnimal Sciences.\nSchedules of Studies\nHonors students complete the Honors\nCollege requirements which replace the\nUCORE requirements.\nDOCTOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE\n(DVM) CURRICULUM\n(153 HOURS)\nThe professional curriculum for the Doctor of\nVeterinary Medicine degree is outlined below.
